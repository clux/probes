My name is Eirik and this site is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and to provide the occasional guide to software.\nPosts herein are my own opinions. Words like we or us is often used in the mathematical sense in posts, and does not imply consensus.\nSoftware\nFor a living, I help automate software operations of modern businesses. Generally, this means integrating existing cloud technologies on Kubernetetes, but occasionally some new tool gets written. Language-wise, the last six years have featured a lot of Rust due to its safety guarantees and great ecosystem, but also like to dabble.\nMy github and sponsors dashboard has a bigger overview, but some of my longer-term projects:\n\n2018 kube :: a kubernetes client and controller runtime for rust (donated to CNCF)\n2016 muslrust :: a musl based build image for the cloud\n2012 tournament :: a tournament state system for arbitrary competition formats\n\nThese days, kube takes the biggest portion of my open source time, as it has grown from a personal yak to a quite popular part of the rust ecosystem. I used to blog about kube, but now I slowly write guides at kube.rs and mostly do issue management and release automation for these repos instead.\nPast colleagues might remember me from these semi-open work projects:\n\n2018 babylon/shipcat :: babylon's helmfile like microservice system (safety fork - was needed lol)\n2016 cisco/lal :: a language agnostic docker based build system (safety fork by the old build team)\n\nAt any rate, software posts here are all over the place. My setup is documented in my dotfiles and provisioning.\nRoleplaying\nIn less busy times, I spent years of my life DMing D&amp;D campaigns. The longest one concluded in pandemic times, and was a large part of my sanity in that period. Am currently absolved from further dubious plot juggling and a campaign related todos, but probably will resuming roleplaying shenanigans at some point\nEducation\nThere exists a dusty, but laminated piece of paper with Master of Mathematics on it. While no one has ever asked to look at it, it keeps being featured on my resume.\nThis esoteric + deteriorating knowledge is mostly used to over-excitedly tell people about group theory, and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all; a solid use of 4 years.\nMusic\nAs a kid, I played violin for a decade. Have got a couple of things to show for this; near perfect recollection of the solo-violinists repertoire, a weird desire to follow violin competitions, and a history of being a good target for bullying.\nNowadays, my 2017 p-series is my weapon of choice, and is helping me recover from violin trauma. It also continues my habit of committing useless chunks of finger movement to muscle memory, but comes with the side-effect of making me watch piano competitions.\nIf you are considering buying a violin for yourself/someone. Buy an otamatone first to see if you think you can handle listening to someone wrangling with a fretless, non-linear interface for years. The instrument UX is terrible. You deserve better.\nGaming\nI prefer to join cooperative multiplayer steam games whenever the stars align timing-wise.\nHowever, in times of procrastination (as is more usually the case), well-designed game mechanics that require some type of dexterity based mastery, or hit a very specific nerd-sniping target, have frequently drawn me in. Here are some time sinks from the ages:\nTheorycraft\n\nDungeon Siege 2: found a mathematical solution to a dungeon in 2006\nBaldur's Gate 2: explored the maths behind character creation in 2022\nFactorio: explored UPS optimizing a 5400SPM base in 2022\n\nFPS\n\nTeam Fortress 2: trolling stage with weird weapons in ~2016\nQuake 3 / promode with VSE + X-Pec + Team Norway; made highlights ~2002\n\nNo death runs\n\nCeleste 200: Core B / Summit B (2019)\nNecrodancer: bolt low% / classic stats (mostly bolt, but did all chars)\nSuper Meat Boy iron man: Cotton / Dark Cotton (2014)\n\nSpeedruns\n\nTrine segmented NG+ speedrun (playlist) in 2010\nMinesweeper Norway #3 Time (Norway -&gt; Time -&gt; Eirik) with 53s expert in 2007\nN tons of former WRs; 70-0 won run of the year in 2007 (nothing to view now)\n\n","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/about/","title":"About"},"https://clux.dev/archive/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/archive/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/antimagic/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/antimagic/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/bg/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/bg/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/factorio/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/factorio/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/foam/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/foam/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/prometheus/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/prometheus/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/running22/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/running22/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/seeding/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/seeding/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/therayne/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/therayne/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/whiteplume/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/whiteplume/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/imgs/wms/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/imgs/wms/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/offline/":{"body":"Offline Mode\nSorry, no cache found and it looks like you’re offline, a connection is required.\n","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/offline/","title":"Offline Mode"},"https://clux.dev/pages/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://clux.dev/pages/","title":""},"https://clux.dev/post/2006-08-09-vault-of-therayne/":{"body":"An easter egg and puzzle solution for Dungeon Siege 2 Broken World.\n \n\nAfter doing the first two rooms of the Treasure Hunt quest, you can attempt two additional puzzles of the same type, but these are ridiculously hard. If you made the second one, you have no doubt noticed that these are much trickier than the general lightning reflection puzzle in the original DS2. The third is manageable with a good dose of trial and error - still more than expected for an otherwise mindless hack'n slash game - but the last one is almost impossible.\nSo I present a mathematical way to solve it.

But after some hours on the couch with pen and paper and ivc to talk to, we found a sensible solution.\nIntro\n\nThe seeding is the correspondence ${p \\mid player} \\leftrightarrow {1,2,\\ldots,2^n}$ where the number $k(p)\\in{1,2,\\ldots,2^n}$ is the estimated ranking for player $p$, i.e. player $p$ is expected to beat player $q$ if and only if $k(p) &gt; k(q)$. The main problem is how to sort the players in the first round so that the the best players meet as late as possible (depending on their skill) in the tournament. The image below illustrates this for $2^3$ players. Formally we say:\nDefinitions\nIf there are $2^n$ players in the tournament then the ordering is proper if the following hold.\n\nIf the seeding is perfect (perfectly predicts the match outcomes) then only the $2^{n+1-k}$ top seeded players are left in round $k$.\nIn each round the sum of the seeds in each match is constant.\nThe even seed in each match is placed at the bottom.\n\n\nIt's a bit much to assume that seedings are perfect, but the seeding above needs these three conditions to generate the analogous binary tree in $n$ dimensions, so we will use them. Besides, condition 2 does sort of provide some loose similar quality guarantee: the lower the sum, the most likely the better the games. The image above fills out what will happen in an eight player tournament if the seeding is perfect.\nKnowing that it was these three properties that we wanted, we could at this point just generated the next level in the canonical tree successively until we got to the desired level to (i.e. make an arbitrarily large tournament system), but this would have been inefficient and a bit tedious (compared to finding patterns in numbers at paper, but that might be subjective). I tried first to find a system in the sequence ${(1),(1,2),(1,4,3,2),(1,8,5,4,3,6,7,2),\\ldots}$, but this turned out to be very fruitless. Having ivc over, I explained the problem to him and we stared at it for a couple of hours (because that's just the kind of inviting friend I am).\nTurns out the key was to look at the match numbers $1,\\ldots,2^{n-1}$ by ordering from the top in the brackets. I.e. match 1 is 1 vs. 8, match 2 is 5 vs. 4 etc. The major clue here is that in a match number that is a power of two, the even numbered seed in that match is also a power of two. In fact match $2^k \\mapsto 2^{n-k}$, so the hard part is interpolating this function for general match numbers.\nThe system becomes clear first when we look at a full 32 player tournament i.e. $n=5$. In the interests of fully testing out the $\\LaTeX$, I would ideally write this out, but tables are a bit of a pain in TeX, and I have this paper anyway.\n\nThis is expanded uniquely using the three defined properties and the smaller bracket above. The match numbers in the first round are written on the left. Notice that the top players all follow diagonal paths when they reach vastly inferior players.\n\nThe system comes from decomposing the match number $i$ as $i=2^k + l$ where $k = \\lfloor \\log_2{i} \\rfloor$. If we write the even seed as powers of two then they display a binary counting system going up between match numbers that are powers of two. In fact, it's the binary representation of $i-2l$ that is required, so let $c_j = bit_j (i-2l)$. We can then verify the final function (sending match number to the even seed in that match).\n$$2^k + l \\mapsto \\begin{cases} 2^{n-k},&amp; \\text{if $l=0$} \\\\ 2^{n-k-1}+2^n \\sum_{j=1} 2^{-j}c_j,&amp; \\text{if $0 &lt; l &lt; 2^k$.}\\end{cases}$$\nPython code\n\nOne of the crazier things I have written in python. And as such, it needs a few notes, especially on the non-zero r (denoted as l earlier in doc) case: nr = binary(i-2*r) reversed (remove leading 0b part of string first). Then shift n-k and add in leading term. However, nr should be k bits, so we need to shift more if not (when reversing leading become trailing) so must shift extra len(nr)-k bits. Without the compensation for extra zeroes the return wouldve looked like this: return int(bin(i-2*r)[2:][::-1],2) &lt;&lt; n-k | 1 &lt;&lt; n-k-1. Insane.\nNote from years later\nThis provided a part of my open source duel tournament library.\nThe code that deals with this particular bit now looks like this:\n\nStill as confusing (if it wasn't for this accompanying blog post).\nThere's probably a more elegant method to be deduced.\nThe method here is just emulating the pattern we see in the binary representation after all. Still, funny what you can do with strings and patterns.\n","description":"Building elimination flows","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2011-03-20-tournament-seeding-placement/","title":"Tournament Seeding Placement"},"https://clux.dev/post/2013-03-20-colemak-switchover/":{"body":"\n\nQWERTY sucks. You always learn it wrong, it's optimized for not jamming your typewriters, and it's got a bunch of history with shortcut keys.\nMy brother started using DVORAK (a similarly unconventional layout) which aims to reduce the number of awkward finger movements using analysis of language and layout experimentations. My problem with DVORAK is that they moved important shortcut keys like X, C, W, Q, S and T so far away from left CTRL that the benefit disappeared. That was a deal-breaker. So while my brother was very happy with his new DVORAK wpm (that hugely improved on his actually dyslexic QWERTY speed), my attachment to passwords kept me hesitating.\nEventually, I figured out that you can bind Alt-Shift (on WIN and Linux) to change back to QWERTY for pattern-based passwords. This was the missing ingredient that allowed a smooth migration.\nThe change was hard initially, but after two months, I had caught up with my old QWERTY speed, and at that point everything felt effortless.\nSo, what to expect?

It took me 2 months to tie that, and now, 2 years after the switch, I have crossed the 100 average mark - and all my fingers are in use!\nThe unusual choice never caused me any real problems, but my QWERTY speed obviouly suffered. The biggest downside is just the amount of time it takes for you hands to get used to it. If you are already typing badly on QWERTY, then go for it; kill two birds with one stone.

It's designed for a party of 8th level characters, and often recommended as weekend interim game to give people a breather from your regular campaign, because of the high likelihood of a total party kill.\nHowever, what's the point of getting three legendary weapons if the one shot is then over? High reward makes even the most careful players willing to confront high risk scenarios, and that can make for a really interesting dungeon crawl.\nI may also have been caught slightly unaware when rereading the boss battles after having lead my 7th level adventurers into the first corridor of this dungeon..\nRegardless. This dungeon seemed like the perfect match for my stunlock heavy, very tactical party of control characters with good equipment.\nCtenmiir\nA Vampire hidden in complete magical darkness, with a strong magical charm that he can perform every round, that does not require concentration, nor allow repeat saves.\nThis encounter was unlike anything the party has faced before. All previous bosses had been either tashaed by our trickster, stun-locked by our monk, or chain-held by our Paladin + Warlock/Sorcerer. But with three legendary resists, high natural saves, and difficulty hitting, only one of these even needed to be spent.\nOne of the reasons for that is that you don't just start a battle like this without some buildup.\nWhy would the vampire want to just start the battle on even ground? Sitting on 17 INT and 18 CHA, he'll want to get in your heads so that he can get a charm off early. And with legendary move actions, he can simply jump around and can generally dodge attacks from any over-eager party member while he attempts to persuade the party.\n\nWell, I would pardon my manners, but it would appear you're the ones who walked into my bedroom.\n\nThen, when the party starts to suspect this may not be a combat encounter, you lean in to one of the heavy hitters and whisper while revealing your face (a condition of the charm to work):\n\nYou're clearly the strongest one in the group. Don't you think this would be much easier without the pointless bloodshed? Protect me and we will all get along very soon.\n\nMake a wisdom saving throw. Silent failure.\nLet's all roll for initiative.\nA game of charms\nBy the end of round 1, the one attempt to dispell the magical darkness had failed, and another party member had been charmed by Ctenmiir (i.e. 2/4), all while he easily kept himself out of harms way. It did not look good.\nSatisfied with the situation, the vampire began feeding on the remaining members. HP drain on the rogue. Warlock down to 8hp. Some hits were taken during the process, but no cause for alarm for the vampire.\nThen, having exhausted all spells that caused saves from the vampire (which he could just legendary resist), the warlock went down a different route:\nHe cast Suggestion, Twinned on the two charmed characters with the instruction:\n\nYou have been charmed by the vampire. Do not listen to him; fight him instead.\n\nWell within the restrictions of the spell. Paladin, Fighter: Make wisdom saving throws against the warlock's spell DC. More failures.\nThus, an interesting equilibrium point was reached. Two players still charmed by the vampire, but one warlock concentrating on maintaining the suggestion to counteract this effect.\nOn cue, Ctenmiir jumps into the face of the warlock to try to break this concentration. Reaction Shield defense is successful. Party gets to now wail on the increasingly frustrated vampire.\nPaladin comes in with a Branding Smite to force the vampire to be permanently visible, and stop regenerating. It's just a question of time before he goes down.\nCtenmiir makes a final crucial attempt to charm the warlock. If successful, the warlock would have to drop his concentration on his twinned suggestion to protect the vampire. Thus, the total number of charmed party members is either 0/4 or 3/4, depending on one wisdom save.\nHe succeeds.\nThe vampire is dispatched over the course of the next round, and his treasure is claimed.\nWhat\nAs a DM, this was one of my most memorable battles so far. So much rested on this insane combination of charms, and it could easily have ended in a TPK.\nIf anyone's deserved their new sentient warhammer, it's them.\nAside\nAs an amusing sidenote; at one point, the rogue history checks for knowledge of vampires (poorly), but still persuades the charmed paladin to \"heal\" the vampire.\n\nThe vampire returns to full health. 😆\n\nA metagaming attempt halted on by a fourth-to-fifth edition confusion.

That is, unless you can impersonate the service account from outside.\n\nEDIT: as of Kubernetes 1.24 the bypass method no longer works.\n..but why would you need to do this?\n1. Testing service account access\nIf you have a way to quickly impersonate a service account you can tell if your rbac verbs, resources are correct and were slash separated in the way kube expects.\nAs an example, to allow shell access into pods, you must grant create on pods/exec in the empty api group (\"\")\n\nIt's safe to say that the groups and resource names are often less than intuitive, and it doesn't help that there is very lackluster errors when applying policies.\n2. kubectl is better than your language-x client\nHaving your app deal with oidc providers is an unnecessary pain point / code path when your app is meant to live in the cluster and authenticate with a service account anyway.\nEven if the language you're writing in is one of the supposedly supported languages, your mileage may vary if it's not Go. Even post 1.11, it's still beta in go.\n3. service accounts can function as group auth\nNot saying you shouldn't have single sign on hooked up to kube, but if you are lacking a good solution at the moment, a few targetted developer accounts with actual rbac policies attached to them is an actual, revokeable solution (as opposed to handing over admin tokens).\nIt does not provide as clean of an audit trail, but if you just want to give read only access to pods, logs, deployments, you might not care.\nImpersonation\nThere are currently two main ways of doing this. The new, limited-use-case way, and the old yaml wrangling method.\nRbac controlled\nThese days, kubectl supports user-impersonation, so if you're just testing access you can use kubectl &lt;verb&gt; &lt;resource&gt; --as=jenkins, provided your user has the impersonate verb set where you need it to:\n\nHowever, this doesn't solve problem 2 or 3 listed above.\nManual impersonation\nThis method extracts the credentials from a service account and adds them as extra entries in your ~/.kube/config. This way most language clients should be able to handle them, and you can have an unobtrusive new context to test.\nThe following implementation requires kubectl, yq, plus the existing rbac access to read service accounts and secrets in the namespace you want to impersonate.\n\nMake it an executable impersonate.sh file and run ./impersonate account namespace. Note that this implementation requires that your context has a namespace.\nFor a budget solution to 3; take the token + secret, store it in a secured vault that you probably already use policies for correctly.

Please see a more recent #kubernetes post.\nThe rest of the post is left unedited for historical reasons.\n..couldn't we have done this for ages?\nYes, but you'd have to set up all the watch machinery yourself and decide on a strategy for tracking the state.\nThe most painstaking part of this is dealing with watch events and its resourceVersion properties directly (metadata returned by kube so you can keep calling watch without getting duplicate events). The events themselves are also returned as newline delimited json, each a wrapped struct of either what you want, or a wrapped error type.\nIn client-go, a lot of this logic is wrapped up in something they call a reflector; a local cache responsible for updating itself and making sure its internal state reflects the state of etcd for the resource it's watching.\nThe land of kube clients\nFirst off, there are several good crates availble for kubernetes usage already. We have k8s-openapi; the increasingly clever set of rust bindings from the openapi spec. There's kubernetes; a is a very sensible convenience wrapper around reqwest + k8s-openapi, but it lacks quite a bit of error handling.\nIn a perfect world, we should all use k8s-openapi because it operates on the sans-io principle where you can just plug in any client. However, it's awkward when dealing with multiple values, and it doesn't really support CRDs well yet and this is the main thing we wanted to use a kube client for.\nSo to tackle the CRD use case, we started out with an older version of the kubernetes crate, before k8s-openapi was added as a dependency, and added error handling.\nStealing Reflectors\nSo we've got an unnecessary fork of a kube client. Let's do something interesting with it. A Reflector&lt;T&gt; is a Sync + Send cache of some T with everything it needs to keep itself up to date:\n\nHere, T is meant to be the deserializable struct you own that represents the .spec portion of a CRD. This is wrapped up in several containers, first Arc + RwLock for thread safety (this data needs to be readable across workers in actix at the very least). The Reflector implements methods for the write() part of RwLock while consumers can read() continuously.\nCache&lt;T&gt; is the state + bookkeeping markers. Ultimately, you are able to extract a BTreeMap&lt;String, T&gt; out of it (aliased to ResourceMap&lt;T&gt;). The key is Named how you like (probably using the .name key of the CRD).\nBy calling the provided .poll() methods as frequently as you'd like, you'll be able to read the up-to-date ResourceMap from .read() and use the Reflector&lt;T&gt; as a cache.\nNew crate: kube\nOnce the Reflector was added and working in our fork, we decided to release it and see how useable it would be directly. The kube crate is available at version 0.2.0 at the moment:\n\nIt should behave like the kubernetes crate, but with more error handling, and various generic structs including reflectors.\nWhether this fork will stick around depends. We were hoping this would serve as, if not a source of inspiration, then a source of ridicule.\nHow would you actually use this?\nEasy. You'll have a struct that defines your CRD:\n\nMake it nameable for quick cache access:\n\ncreate your state container with an instance of Reflector&lt;FooResource&gt;:\n\nThis is useable, but it won't update without you driving it. Let's make a nice constructor with some methods on it, since it'll be the interface you'll use from your application (and maybe you'll need more resources):\n\nwith that set up, we can set up a simple system that runs the reflector, by making sure Reflector::poll is called continuously. Here we illustrate it by using a simple thread, that polls every 10 seconds (the same as kube's internal timeout for watch calls):\n\nThe .poll() call watch for events since the last internal resourceVersion and modify the Cache according to the WatchEvent returned by kubernetes. If for some reason we've desynced and the resourceVersion is too old (happens occasionally) then the Reflector will attempt to refresh the full state internally.\nExposing it from actix\nTo wrap this up and use it in an actix-web application, create your kube::config, pass it to init to start and initialize your State. The state can be embedded straight onto App::data:\n\nand from there, it's more or less following actix examples to read shared state in an http handler. The following will do:\n\nFull example\nTo see how it's all put together, you can browse the source for operator-rs; a full example that you can deploy directly onto kube with its 7MB docker image using only the necessary access\nUnresolved problems\nThis is an early stage happy path. It works for custom resources very well, but any other resources can benefit from k8s-openapi as a side-dependency at the moment.\nWhen can we use this for Pods/Deployments/X?\nThe chosen abstraction in the kube client is one targetting an ApiResource, which maps onto a url of the form /apis/{group}/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/{resource}. A lot of the kube apis use that format (pods has /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/), so it might be somewhat be reuseable between all native structs once we get some optionals in this:\n\nWhile this is arguably an optimistic use of kube's rest api, it might be the simpler approach than having a bunch of massive function wrappers doing more or less the same thing.\nSimilarly, our WatchEvent enum might also be reuseable:\n\nThis type of watch events seem to come out of many watch calls, but it's equally unclear if it can be used correctly in a generic setting.\nThe same can be said about our Metadata, Resource&lt;T&gt;, and ResourceList&lt;T&gt;. These are defined in resource.rs, and are currently unexported implementation details of kube. If they are useful, it's possible that these will be exposed in future versions of kube.\nThere's an interesting discussion about similar generic design in k8s-openapi#20.\nThe plan is to test it out a bit further on data types beyond CRDs and see how well it generalizes, because it'd be a nice api to just use the resource names and groups we already know how to use from kube rbac rules.\nA thread for polling? Why not actors?\nWhy not indeed. It might be better to expose actors? We have not tried yet.\nIt might be a better fit long term, especially if we try to go down this route futher with Informer&lt;T&gt;. It's a more complicated lifecycle model for the type of complexity we're showcasing here though.\nLibrary Divergence?\nWhat about the fact that there's now like 3 kube clients in rust land, all of which have the same config parsing and x509 gunk?\nYeah, that's not great.\nMaybe there's a need for an actual crate that deals with Configuration alone so that effort isn't duplicated.\nIt might also be good if we could factor this subjective view of what a reflector should do out of a kube library, but that style of sans-io based setup would require some restructuring.\nBut I was too tired to go on\nThat's the state of things as of 30/04/19. There's likely dragons around the corner, as well as missing features not ported from existing clients. Suggestions and ideas are welcome.\nObligatory shout-out to one of the best libraries of rust: serde for generating generic serialization/deserialization code on top of generic structs. There was a bit of a learning curve to implement bounds, but thankfully, the most complicated stuff that ended up being in kube was this one-line annotation:\n\nNext steps\nWould be to port raftcat (a small operator in babylon's cloud) to use this client. Hopefully, after some battle testing in a slightly more advanced setting, this stuff can be less  mode.\nEDIT: Resolved in kube 0.6.0\nThe above is untouched, but out of date now. Here are the major changes in 0.6.0:\n\nthe Named trait deemed unnecessary (just using metadata.name instead)\nNative kube objects are supported\nWatchEvent type has been changed and exposed via a new Informer struct\nhandling events directly is now possible\npolling is easier now\n\nAnother thing that's been highlighted is the misuse of kubernetes terminology. This is more describing a controller than an operator.\n\noperator-rs has been renamed to controller-rs\n\nAdditionally, raftcat was easily portable to use Reflectors and so provides a bigger example.\nSee the follow-up blog post on this.\n","description":"Writing light weight cloud services without go","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2019-04-29-rust-on-kubernetes/","title":"Kubernetes operators in rust"},"https://clux.dev/post/2019-06-04-towards-a-generic-kube-client/":{"body":"It's been about a month since we released kube, a new rust client library for kubernetes. We covered the initial release, but it was full of naive optimism and uncertainty. Would the generic setup work with native objects? How far would it extend? Non-standard objects? Patch handling? Event handling? Surely, it'd be a fools errand to write an entire client library?\nWith the last 0.10.0 release, it's now clear that the generic setup extends quite far. Unfortunately, this yak is hairy, even by yak standards.\n\nUpdate from 2021\nThis post is old and many details herein are severely outdated.\nA few EDIT: markers have been highlighted to point out the biggest changes, but the rest of the post is left unedited for historical reasons.\nConsider checking for a more recent #kubernetes post.\nOverview\nThe reason this library even works at all, is the amount of homebrew generics present in the kubernetes API.\nThanks to the hard work of many kubernetes engineers, most API returns can be serialized into some wrapper around this struct:\n\nYou can infer a lot of the inner api workings by looking at apimachinery/meta/types.go. Kris Nova's 2019 FOSDEM talk on [the internal clusterfuck of kubernetes]\n(https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/kubernetesclusterfuck/) also provides a much welcome, rant-flavoured context.\nBy taking advantage of this, we can provide a much simpler interface to what the generated openapi bindings can provide. But it requires some other abstractions:\nMore object patterns\nLet's compare some openapi generated structs:\n\nPodList\nNodeList\nDeploymentList\n\nAll with identical contents. You could just define this generic struct:\n\nSimilarly, the query parameters optionals structs:\n\nListNodeOptional\nListPodForAllNamespacesOptional\nListDeploymentForAllNamespacesOptional\n\nThese are a mouthful. And again, almost all of them have the same fields. Not going to go through the whole setup here, because the TL;DR is that once you build everything with the types.go assumptions in mind, a lot just falls into place and we can write our own generic api machinery.\nApi machinery\nIf you follow this rabbit hole, you can end up with the following type signatures:\n\nThese are the main query methods on our core Api (docs / src). Observe that similar types of requests take the same *Params objects to configure queries. Return types have clear patterns, and serialization happens before entering the Api.\nThere's is no hidden de-multiplexing on the parsing side. When calling list, we just turbofish that type in for serde to deal with internally:\n\nWhere, typically K = Object&lt;P, U&gt;, but actually; K is something implementing a KubeObject trait. This is our one required trait, and you shouldn't don't have to deal with it because of an automatic blanket implementation for K = Object&lt;P, U&gt;.\nclient-go semantics\nWhile it might not seem like it with all this talk about generics; we are actually trying to model things a little closer to client-go and internal kube apimachinery (insofar as it makes sense).\nJust have a look at how client-go presents Pod objects or Deployment objects. There's already a pretty clear overlap with the above signatures.\nMaybe you are in the camp with Bryan Liles, who said that \"client-go is not for mortals\" during his kubecon 2019 keynote. It's certainly a large library (sitting at ~80k lines of mostly go), but amongst the somewhat cruft-filled chunks, it does embed some really interesting patterns to consider.\nThe terminology in this library should therefore be a lot more familiar now. Not only are using ideas from client-go, our core assumptions come from api-concepts, and we otherwise try to take inspiration from frameworks such as kubebuilder. That said, we are inevitably going to hit some walls when kubernetes isn't as generic as we inadvertently promised it to be.\nBut delay that tale; let's first look at how to use the Api:\nApi Usage\nUsing the Api now amounts to choosing one of the constructors for the native / custom type(s) you want and use with the verbs listed above.\nFor Pod objects, you can construct and use such an object like:\n\nHere the p is an Object&lt;PodSpec, PodStatus&gt;. This leverages k8s-openapi for PodSpec and PodStatus as the source of these large types.\nIf needed, you can define these structs yourself, but as an example, let's show how that plays in with CRDs; because custom resources require you to define everything about them anyway.\n\nThis is all you need to get your \"code generation\". No external tools to shell out to; cargo build gives you your json serialization/deserialization, and the generic Api gives you your api machinery.\nYou can therefore interact with your customResource as follows:\n\nHere we are fetching and parsing straight into the Foo object on .get().\nSo what about posting and patching? For brevity, let's use the serde_json macro:\n\nEasy enough, if a tad verbose. What about a patch?\n\nHere json! really shines. The macro is actually also so context-aware, that you can reference variables, and even attach structs to keys within.\nHigher level abstractions\nWith the core api abstractions in place, an easy abstraction is Reflector&lt;K&gt;: an automatic resource cache for a K which - through sustained watch calls - ensures its cache reflect the etcd state. We have talked about Reflectors earlier; so let's cover Informers.\nEDIT: Informers and Reflectors were deprecated as of 2020 in  favour of the kube-runtime crate.\nInformers\nAn informer for a resource is an event notifier for that resource. It calls watch when you ask it to, and it informs you of new events. In go, you attach event handler functions to it. In rust, we just pattern match our WatchEvent enum directly for a similar effect:\n\nThe o being destructured here is an Object&lt;NodeSpec, NodeStatus&gt;. See informer examples for doing something with the objects.\nTo actually initialize and drive a node informer, you can do something like this:\n\nThe harder parts typically come if you need a separate threads; like one to handle polling, one for handling events async, perhaps you are interacting with a set of threads in an tokio/actix runtime.\nYou should handle these cases, but it's thankfully, not hard. You can just give out a clone of your Informer to the runtime. The controller-rs example shows how trivial it is to encapsulate an informer and drive it along actix (using the 1.0.0 rc). The result is a complete example controller in a tiny alpine image.\nInformer Internals\nInformers are just wrappers around a watch call that keeps track of resouceVersion. There's very little inside of it:\n\nIf it wasn't for the extra internal event queue (that users are meant to consume), we could easily have built Reflector on top of Informer. The only main difference is that a Reflector uses the events to maintain an up-to-date BTreeMap rather than handing the events out.\nAs with Reflector, we rely on this foundational enum (now public) to encapsulate events:\n\nYou can compare with client-go's WatchEvent.\nDrawbacks\nSo. What's awful?\nEverything is camelCase!\nYeah.. #![allow(non_snake_case)]. It's arguably more helpful to be able to easily cross reference values with the main API docs using Go conventions, than to map them to rust's snake_case preference.\nThat said, we currently rely on k8s-openapi (and that crate maps cases..). Do people have strong feelings about this?\nEDIT: This stopped being true in 2020.\nDelete returns an Either\nThe delete verb akwardly gives you a Status object (sometimes..), so we have to maintain logic to conditionally parse those kind values (where we expect them) into an Either enum. This means users have to map_left to deal with the \"it's not done yet\" case, or map_right for the \"it's done\" case (crd example). Maybe there's a better way to do this. Maybe we need a more semantically correct enum.\nSome resources are true snowflakes\nWhile we do handle the generic subresources like Scale, some objects has a bunch of special subresources associated with them.\nThe most common example is v1Pod, which has pods/attach, pods/portforward, pods/eviction, pods/exec, pods/log, to name a few. Similarly, we can drain or cordon a v1Node. So we clearly have non-standard verbs and non-standard nouns.\nThis is probably solveable with some blunt generic_verb_noun hammer on RawApi (see #30) for our supported apis.\nIt clearly breaks the generic model somewhat, but thankfully only in the areas you'd expect it to break.\nEDIT: This stopped being a problem in 2020.\nNot everything follows the Spec + Status model\nYou might think these exceptions make up a short and insignificant list of legacy objects, but look at this subset:\n\nRoleBinding with subjects + roleRef\nRole with a rules vec\nConfigMap - with data + binaryData\nEndpoints - with a subsets vector\nEvent - with 17 random fields!\nServiceAccount - secrets vector + misc fields\n\nAnd that was only like 20 minutes in the API docs. Long story short, we eventually stopped relying on Object&lt;P, U&gt; everywhere in favour of KubeObject. This meant we could deal with these special objects in mod snowflake, without feeling too dirty about it..\nEDIT: This stopped being a problem in 2020.\nRemaining toil\nWhile many of the remaining tasks are not too difficult, there are quite a few of them:\n\nintegrating all the remaining native objects (can be done one-by-one)\nsupport more than patch --type=merge\nbackoff crate use for exponential backoff =&gt; less cascady network failures\nsupport local kubeconfig auth providers\n\nThe last one is a huge faff, with differences across providers, all in the name of avoiding impersonating a service accounts when developing locally.\nHelp\nThe foundation is now there, in the sense that we feel like we're covering most of the theoretical bases (..that we could think of).\nHelp with examples/object support/stuff listed above would be greatly appreciated at this point. Hopefully, this library will end up being useful to some. With some familiarity with rust, the generated docs + examples should get you started.\nAnyway, if you do end up using this, and you work in the open, please let us link to your controllers for examples.\n&lt;/🐂💈&gt;\n","description":"Shaving a yak for a client-rust","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2019-06-04-towards-a-generic-kube-client/","title":"A generic kubernetes client"},"https://clux.dev/post/2019-07-28-lxde-experiment/":{"body":"Despite having been a lazy Cinnamon customer since the Linux Mint days, recently some interesting benchmarks started surfacing about input lag in various Window Mangagers, and this made me want to experiment a little.\nThis is a log of stuff I needed to tweak to get LXDE working well.\n\nLXDE\n\nLXDE is a free desktop environment with comparatively low resource requirements. This makes it especially suitable for use on older or resource-constrained personal computers such as netbooks or system on a chip computers.\n\nAlrighty. A C based WM using GTK+ 2. Not used this since Gnome 2, back in the 2012 days.\nInstallation\nAlready had Arch Linux running LightDM as my Display Manager, so only needed the base install:\n\nThen, logged out of cinnamon, and switched WM from the login screen to LXDE. Easy.\nInput Lag\nTested this out immediately to see if it felt better. Funnily enough, I can only tell in certain games that require a bunch of precise inputs. Most of my other currently installed games felt the same. But they aren't really twitchy enough to tell.\nThat said, Necrodancer definitely felt better. No longer any recogonizable input lag when playing Bolt or Coda, and had issues with those before on cinnamon.\nQuirks\nKeyboard bindings\nTo be able to use this at all, I need some keyboard shortcuts to move windows between monitors. I tend to use Super+Left and Super+Right.\nIt was quite akward to set this up with lxhotkey. The magical incantation (which took almost an hour to figure out) was:\n\n\"MoveResizeTo\": \"monitor:prev\" : &lt;Super&gt;Left\n\"MoveResizeTo\": \"monitor:next\" : &lt;Super&gt;Right\n\nInterestingly, lxhotkey is a 700 line .c file last touched 3 years ago.\nNo way to bind Super to open the main menu AFAIKT, and man, that was hard to unlearn. Not that it matters, because there's no fuzzy start and type on the main menu anyway. Amazing how tied you get to that. Not sure I can deal with not having that now. Maybe there's some kind of fzf panel type thing I can install?\nMissing out of the box\nScreen locker\nScreensaver button kept spinning, timing out. Turns out xscreensaver was not installed. Installing it fixed it, but it also pulled in like 15 perl packages, and looked absolutely awful.\nEnded up installing slock straight from pacman instead. No dependencies there, and it's one c file. No user input. Just a tree color screen. Black when locked, blue while typing, red on wrong password.\nDidn't have to actually write slock anywhere. It just worked after installing it (lxlock apparently figures this out). I had taken out the broken xscreensaver ref in ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart anyway though.\nTransparency\nThis is kind of necessary for me for any terminals as I frequently overlay them on code with ~70% opacity. Installing xcompmgr straight from pacman and adding xcompmgr &amp; to ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart fixed it.\nLook and feel\nMain panel\nNeeded about 15 minutes of configuration, and it ended up being stored in a 129 line file in ~/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel But ended up looking very nice. Transparency on the bar itself was a nice touch.\n\nThough you can see that it gets confused if you have set a different background on each monitor, which is something you can do for some reason.\n\nFile manager\nFine, could make it look like nemo in 5 minutes. You can see it in the background above. Had it's config in a tiny: ~/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE/pcmanfm.conf.\nGeneral Theme\nDefault theme is quite ugly due to the overly glossy black panel, so you probably have to that transparent anyway. Everything kind of only fits the dark theme IMO. Went for the only decent one: Adwaita-dark, but put on Mikachu window borders. Nothing amazing, but completely fine.\nTiny file in ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/desktop.conf controls this.\nArticles exist online on how to install themes for it, but that's probably the gtk3 version. The few I tried didn't work.\nVerdict\nThe most awkward thing is the lack of a launcher bar so far. Performance is great. Keybindings are mostly workeable. If some better tiling-like commands can be set up maybe you can make do with alacritty.\nSeems completely useable. Most configs stashed in this PR.\n","description":"How useful is a power optimized WM these days?","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2019-07-28-lxde-experiment/","title":"Trying out LXDE"},"https://clux.dev/post/2020-09-27-second-brain/":{"body":"After 2 years of running a D&amp;D campaign almost every week, my note taking setup reached several breaking points. If you're using OneNote or another online managed system for tracking notes/cities/npcs/pcs/events, but know how to use programmers tools like git and code; boy are there a world of advantages available to you.\nThis is a story of my original note talking setup, a comparison between newer technologies, and how I am back to writing markdown in a folder.\n\nThe OneNote Setup\nEarly in 2018, we were starting to play weekly, and my various documents in google docs were not cutting it.\nI watched a couple of videos detailing how to Manage a D&amp;D campaign with OneNote. The double categorisation setup where Sections contain many Pages was nice, the promise of links was promising, but unfortunately, the difficulty of creating them made them too slow to really be viable.\nA year down the line, my OneNote looked like this:\n\nStill, image integration straight from a google search and into your document was great. Well, not Google, but Bing, I guess. In practice, I wasn't always sure what I was going for, so I often ended up searching for images in my browser first via google, getting shunted to pinterest and find something promising there. Since OneNote returned completely different images, I generally had to save and upload my findings anyway.\nOneNote did let you place random text fields anywhere on your page (like some kind of janky e-scrap book), and this did actually help get around one problem I was having:\n\nsplitting the data is hard in a browser\n\nWhy? You click on a link, the browser makes several HTTP requests, and after waiting 400ms you finally get to see the results (one drive is not super responsive), but this movement drops your place to the current page you needed to cross reference with. So now you either go back, and shift-click the reference so you now have two tabs that you can Shift-Tab between, or you prepare those tabs up in advance (typically before the session).\nIn practice I often ended up with a 30 tab browser window for every session, which generally, looked something like:\n\nthis type of tab/icon chaos generally included:\n\n5 from OneNote (campaign brain)\n2 from Kobold Fight Club (potential encounters)\n6 from monsters / items\n2 youtube ambient music tabs\n2 for random generators\n5 from lore/wikis related to the story or NPCs\n\nand their multitude meant I needed to tab between them to find the right one, only to have to change them when players did something out of left field.\n\nDMs; does this happen to you?\n\nSo this system definitely had problems, but it was free, generally responsive, and the 400ms link opening time wasn't too much of a drain on the improv. It was definitely noticable though, and it just took a slightly decreased OneNote QoS, or a few interrupted WIFI evenings, for it all to feel pointless.\n..there was also a whole week where I was unable to save anything with no errors shown to me. I never get to the bottom of it, but it was the last straw.\nThe Git Repository\nAfter these problems, I realised that there's one thing I'm unwilling to compromise on:\n\nMy notes must be available offline\n\nIf that means I have to do a full sync up front; fine. A folder of documents behind git solves this. This also solves the merge conflict resolution problem that OneNote was giving me due to the way it hid its synchronisation mechanism. Imagine arriving back at your desktop computer only to find that your laptop didn't sync, so you either have to boot your laptop back up, or solve a merge conflict (with yourself) the next time you open your laptop (on an interface somehow worse than git). Not great.\nNow I just git commit and git push, and never get a merge conflict.\nThat means that no matter how slick the following solutions look:\n\nWorld Anvil\nNotion\nRoam\n\nThese solutions are off the table for me. Even if some of them might be a reasonable abstraction.\nWith an offline document repo, it was immediately easy to get back the basic functionality needed; categorised text in sections (folders) and pages (markdown files within folder), and an offline way to access them (cloned repo).\n\nThe Markdown\nUsing Markdown as the documention format is a no-brainer to me as a software engineer. This defacto documentation standard used nearly everywhere, supported by every major code editor.\nStill, many of the same problems I had with OneNote still manifested themselves:\n\nlinking markdown files requires lookup and hard-coding of filesystem paths\ntendency to store everything in one file because linking is annoying\nguessing what tabs are needed in your editor before the session\nembedding images is a bit of a pain\n\nNow, none of these in theory were unsolvable. But was this something where homegrowing my own content management markdown system was really a smart way forward? After all, surely people writing books or research papers need some kind of system to keep track of everything, right?\nZettelkasten\nThere are probably millions of ways to organise your stuff and still be successful, just take a look at some famous writers' desks:\nSince it's a Monday, let's play which fantasy writer's desk would you want to write at:1. Ursula K. Le Guin's2. Neil Gaiman's3. J.R.R. Tolkien's4. Terry Pratchett's pic.twitter.com/hsMRgI0JEh— Into The Forest Dark (@ElliottBlackwe3) September 21, 2020 \n\nIndividualism notwithstanding, some methods are more refined than others. For instance, this article on sociologist Niklas Luhmann and his Zettelkasten system talks about one refined system. Do at least skim that article for why that solution is so powerful. It brings up some very important data modelling problem inherent to note taking:\n\ndo we categorise notes by folders?\ndo we categorise notes by tags?\ndo we categorise notes by links?\n\nAll these methods on their own cause data to get lost, but using all of them at the same time gives you a stronger, self-reinforcing system. If Luhmann could achieve this with a simple slip box system of index cards, then making your editor do it should be childs play.\nThough, why this system? Well, for one it's an organic extension of what you already are doing. You don't need to follow it entirely, but the benifits of links and connection notes are huge. From the principles listed in that article. Number 3 in particular:\n\nAlways link your notes\nWhenever you add a note, make sure to link it to already existing notes. Avoid notes that are disconnected from other notes. As Luhmann himself put it, \"each note is just an element that derives its quality from the network of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten\"\n\nThis feels like good D&amp;D advice as well. An NPC already known by a player can be a lot easier and more sensible to re-instate, rather than fabricate a slightly different version of one of your 10 existing characters. Need a \"dark city\", but drawing a blank? Make a shadowfell version of of the same city and link them. Easier to remember for everybody. A campaign quickly accumulates a lot of information. No need to make this harder than it already is.\nConsidered Choices\n1. Sublime ZK\nThere is a zettelkasten plugin for sublime, but it looks pretty abandoned at the moment. It also does not seem to let you build a graph of your links (one of the main selling points of Obsidian).\n2. Obsidian\nThe article by joshwin on how he uses obsidian to manage goals, tasks, notes, and more is interesting. A pre-configured all-in-one application that is flexible and powerful enough to let you handle all these different categories. Well worth looking into if you don't have a good editor already. Their feature list is decent.\nPersonally, though, there are reasons why I'm not going for this:\nCustom Editor\nWhile it looks like you can customize this scope-limited editor close to what you fancy, it does mean that you will need to do go through all that yet another time. Having battled with Vim/Sublime/VSCode and various editors over the course of my life, there was a point where I have started feeling satisfied with what past-clux had already configured.\nCustom Install\nThe only provided linux install a single snap package. While snap might become a successful and perhaps the most prominent packaging distribution system on linux, it's nowhere near that tipping point yet; especially on Arch. There's no need for me to introduce an extra daemon to auto-upgrade packages when there's already a solid system on Arch that lets me do this.\nCustom Formats\nAs with any another system bundling some pinned electron version, you now have yet another piece of software that will have security patches neglected as if development suddenly stops.\nSure, you can keep your data because you can store it wherever, but if they control the system that defines the format then it would be super annoying to have to do a migration to something else.\nVendor locked plugins\nOne way out of this would be to have custom plugins, but their plugin API is not exposed (though on their roadmap).\nUltimately, even if this eventually did get solved, I'd still rather go with a plugin system in a code editor I already know how to use, and backup, than to get locked in to something forked off electron where the development may stop at any time.\n3. Orgmode with Roam\nAnother all-emcompassing standard that hasn't really caught on as widely; orgmode. Looks a bit like markdown, but has a lot more support for things I don't see an immediate need for. It seems kind of coupled with the emacs/lisp ecosystem, so if that's your preference; check out org-roam. For me, this is a bit too off the beaten path.\n4. Foam\nWe close with foam, the system we ended up using. Inspired by Roam (a system I neglected to talk about because of sync/offline problems, and it's also not cheap).\nWhile it does seem somewhat early stage, the selling point here is that Foam is really just a collection of VS Code extensions around markdown, that you can default-recommend at the repo level and configure how you want.\nThe main ones here are:\n\nfoam.foam-vscode - foam's own extension\nkortina.vscode-markdown-notes - markdown [[wiki-links]] and backlinking\ntchayen.markdown-links - graphs markdown linked notes\nyzhang.markdown-all-in-one - markdown writing helpers\nesbenp.prettier-vscode - an auto-formatter\neamodio.gitlens - online git history\n\nAll of which are very popular, standard extensions, with the sole exception of the foam; a smaller looking extension that helps manage the wiki links. Frankly, it's somewhat strange to me that they list the off-putting tolerance for alpha software as a requirement when most of their logic resides outside their codebase.\nIf you've dealt with a code editors plugin ecosystem before, this is a lot more welcoming than obsidian to me. Bug in the system? Well, probably one of the extensions. You've got options for dealing with it: report &amp; wait, fork + fix, try other replacement extensions.\nOh, and I can we can swap out the default provided dark theme for one you like, e.g. Seti:\n\nFinally, if you need extra functionality, you now have the whole wealth of the VS Code ecosystem at your fingertips.\nSo far, these have been useful addons for providing extra functionality:\n\nmushan.vscode-paste-image - paste image from clipboard functionality\n\nResult\nSo that was a lot of information about comparison of note taking technology. How does my system actually end up looking? Depends on whether I am editing or running a game. Here is a 3-way split between editing and showing the graph update live.\n\nThe graphs sometimes overlaps and rebalances awkwardly (help seems to be requested), but the naive implementation still help out a whole lot.\nHere is a subset from our sea adventures aboard the Artemis:\n\nMost of the time I just straight up edit markdown in two groups. Sometimes with a preview or graph instead on the right or below, depending on what type of work needs focus. The flexibility of this system is equivalent to that of a popular professional code editor by inheritance.\nEven if some of these plugins don't evolve much, I see this as a pretty future proof setup (the why foam issue is also refreshingly honest). The investment in new tech is small, and migration cost away from said tech ought to be minimal.\nFrom a RPG perspective, being able to immediately jump to anything through a responsive fuzzy search helps trim down on those \"hang on one second\" moments, and when you are planning by yourself, you have a whole linked compendium of knowledge.\nThe hope with all this is that the amount of hard-to-navigate \"running the game tabs\" should be significantly reduced with this setup, and my world should feel more integrated thanks to the extensive Zettelkasten style linking. Well. Fingers crossed anyway.\n","description":"Exploring second brain alternatives for campaign tracking","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2020-09-27-second-brain/","title":"Foaming Campaign Brain"},"https://clux.dev/post/2020-10-04-antimagic-revisited/":{"body":"In 2018, we introduced the explosive Cube of Force into our home campaign. We really did not expect it to cause us/me that much grief at the time, but despite long canonicalisation meetings, our interpretation was not even internally consistent.\nAt the time we dealt with this by nerfing Cube down into the ground gradually rolling out alternatives, but it's time we dug into the concept of D&amp;D antimagic properly.\n\nWords of wording\nSpell combinations are an inherently powerful thing in D&amp;D, and so any spells that \"cancels out magic\" - potentially interacting with Dispel Magic - must be carefully worded. And while Wizards does a good job with this, there are still ambiguities that end up at JeremyECrawford's table:\nHave a D&amp;D rules question? There's a good chance I've answered it!1. Search the Sage Advice Compendium: https://t.co/nlIvbEC7D7.2. Search Twitter, typing my handle (@JeremyECrawford) and a relevant term, like \"Twinned Spell.\"3. Search https://t.co/5oYKuatgLB. #DnD pic.twitter.com/JXtO9catjP— Jeremy Crawford (@JeremyECrawford) November 18, 2017 \n\nthe referenced Sage Advice Compendium contains 21 pages of Q/A as well as links to erratas for published books.\nWe'll focus on two spells that deal with antimagic, the philosophy and intent behind them, then we will tackle the Cube.\nForceCage\nForceCage (or FC for short) first; is a 7th level mechanism to trap players while also limiting how spells can interact with trapped players:\n\nFC; \"creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any Spells cast into or out of the area\".\n\nThis wording only mentions the casting; i.e. the line from the caster to the point of origin. Fireball's blast would extend through, and any damaging concentration spell sitting in the middle before the cage comes down would also keep ticking every round without proper recourse.\nIt is a deadly combination when used with spells like Hunger of Hadar (10 rounds), Cloudkill (100 rounds), or higher level clouds if available. Oh, but we'll just dispel..\n\nFC: This spell can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic.\n\n\nScary prospect though it may be, you can wrangle yourself out of it with using; Plane Shift / Teleport / Misty Step / Dimension Door on a successful charisma check. All it takes is for one player to get outside and stop the mage from hurling spell effects through the boundary. It is also possible to Disintegrate it.\nStill it highlights a difference with other antimagic. The barrier is not perfect, and the \"effect\" of the spell leeches through the barrier of the cage, which is perhaps somewhat confusing when you can sometimes interpret the spell effect as matter. This is irrelevant as we'll see later; while a spell caster is shaping the underlying magical fabric; the effect is a magical energy.\n\nTip: Try to catch yourself if you are trying to invoke special relativity or thermodynamics in D&amp;D. Physics is not tied to linguistic constructs.\n\nAntimagic Field\nAntimagic Field (or AMF for short), is an 8th level sphere that disallows spells cast in/out as well as magical effects leeching through! The reason for the great increase in cancellation power is justified by its higher level, careful wording, and its lack of entrapment (people can walk out of it unlike FC).\n\nAMF: Any active spell or other magical Effect on a creature or an object in the Sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\nThe blast of a fireball detonating outside an AMF simply disappears into nothing at the boundary of its sphere of influence.\nBut what happens if you throw a Delayed Blast Fireball inside an area, and put an AMF around the area, while powering up the fireball from the outside? This, really claws at the heart of the word \"suppressed\"; is the fireball bead still there? Will it keep working after the AMF disappears? Has it powered up in the mean time? Has the duration elapsed?\nThis is a harder corner-case, and requires some more guidance. And as far as corner-cases go, it's not alone, just think about:\n\nclass abilities like paladin's smite, monk's ki points, druid shapeshifting\nmonster abilities like dragon's breath, beholder rays\nsummoned creatures\n\nTo answer whether these count as magical, we need some disambiguation.\nWhat is a magical effect?\nThe best source here come from the interview with Crawford from 2017 about antimagic and what they mean by suppressing magic.\nThe short answer is that spells are not dispelled, they temporarily stop working, and the duration of spells keeps ticking.\nHe justifies it by describing magic in the D&amp;D world as always existing in the background; a loose weave. Magical effects is this fabric formed into a particular shape; background magic woven into an effect - using a formula. \"AMF introduces a [temporary] bug in this formula.\" Whereas Dispel Magic disperses that woven magic from a spell into background magic.\nBecause the world is inherently magical - and creatures like dragons and beholders would not make sense without it - AMF could not possibly cancel this type of magic (as this would undo the very nature of the multiverse). Neither could it cancel non-magical effects that were created through the means of past magic. However:\n\nAMF: \"You will not see any effects of magic while inside this field. The area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse\".\n\nThis text establishes a need to distinguish those types of magic from the others. This is where we consult the heuristic test from the Sage Advice Compendium inlined below:\nTest for magical effects\nAnswer YES to any of these to be classified as magical (and thus have AMF suppress its effect):\n\nIs it a magic item?\nIs it a spell?\nIs it a spell attack?\nIs it creating the effects of a spell mentioned in its description?\nIs it fueled by spell slots\nDoes the words magic or magical appear in its description?\n\nExamples\nWhile this seems like a well-thought-out heuristic, the results they mention are interesting:\n\nConjured creatures relying on concentration are magical\nSummoned creatures with instant cast duration are NOT magical\n\nBecause the summoning has already taken place in the latter case.\nThe corollary is that:\n\nConjured creatures (concentration-based) disappear\nConjured creatures reappear when the field disappear (unless concentration was lost)\nSummoned creatures not concentration-based can traverse the field (they are not persisting because of a spell anymore)\nYou still have to make concentration checks when hit\n\nAdditionally, the following phenomenons (that at some point required magic to bring into existence) are not considered magical:\n\nFire created by Prestidigitation (if it has a reason to keep burning)\nA Dragon and its breath weapon\nA Beholder and its Antimagic Cone (though it functions like AMF)\n\n\nArtifacts\nFinally, Artifacts - magic items either unavailable to mortals, or long forgotten - are also unaffected by AMF by a special flavour text (presumably to prevent you from destroying them):\n\nAMF: Spells and other magical Effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the Sphere and can't protrude into it.\n\nThus, they probably have their full abilities unmodified completely - even if it can cast spells, like Blackrazor's Haste ability. The magic of deities cannot be modified by mortals.\nInterpretting the rest\nSpellcasters with an active Find Familiar leave a bunch of open ended questions on how you can interact with them, even though the familiar clearly lingers. Telepathy is magical, and if telepathy is magical, then so is sharing of senses between a familiar (at least that is my interpretation).\nAdditionally; a warlock's Pact Magic, their Eldritch Invocations, blade pactweapons, and Mystic Arcanum are all magical by their wording.\nSimilarly, a sorcerer can't use sorcery points, as they \"create [..] magical effects\", nor can they use the clearly magical; Metamagic.\nThe PHB mentions that the monk's ki energy draws on magical energy, but this is apparently only meant to mean the \"background magic in the multiverse\" Crawford says in the interview, and goes on to say:\n\n\"we only consider individual monk ability to be magical if we've put the word magic/magical/magically in that particular monk ability\"\n\nA quick search through reference text seem to only mention:\n\nKI-Empowered strikes\nFey Step\nBlessing of the Raven Queen\nCasting spells via Way of the Four Elements\n\nso Flurry/Patient Defense or even Stunning Strike is not magical.\nThe paladin only has a few similar references:\n\nChannel Divinity is magical\nSacred Weapon is magical (weapon no longer get the +1 if it got it)\nDivine Health is magical (no longer immune to disease)\nDivine Smite is not magical - but you can't use it to expend spell slots!\n\nThe druid's Wild Shape is magical and would temporarily drop within an AMF.\nThe ranger is more straightforward. Only spells matter, and while Hunter's Mark will linger, it does so under concentration, and its effect will be suppressed if either of you are inside of an AMF.\nDelayed Blast Fireball\nThis brings us to the curious case of Delayed Blast Fireball. Some answers are provided by Crawford here, though they still leave some wiggle room.\nIt's clear that an active DBF should have its duration elapse inside an AMF from what Crawford says in the interview, but it is still a concentration spell that increases in damage every round because of concentration:\n\nDBF: When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.\n\n\nThe spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of Your Turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\n\nYour concentration is not broken by AMF, and there's nothing explicitly indicating that a magical transference of energy occurs while concentrating. To take the spell at face value; the bead just needs the concentration to exist (it's not explicitly doing anything magical each round), and it immediately detonates when the link is severed:\n\n\nIf concentration is broken while the bead is inside an AMF, then bad luck. Nothing happens.\n\n\nIf there is a surpressed bead inside an expiring AMF, then hey, surprise; the bead can glow once more; and more intensely than before. Concentration paid off.\n\n\nThere's plenty of arguments to be made about how counterintuitive this is, but we don't really know anything about the nature of concentration. The general consensus is that this works.\n\nThis is probably a good thing, because a similar case can be made against DBF inside Time Stop; a tradition that is too cool to not work.\nAntimagic Field vs...\n1. ForceCage\nLet's look at how cancellation texts interact; ForceCage does not prevent magic being cast inside as long as the point of origin does not cross the boundary; so AMF suppresses FC.\nThe result being a 10ft sphere sphere partially protruding a 10x10ft `FC rectangle, allowing for some funny geometrical problems - if you are inclined to do some on-the-fly trig.\n\nAMF: If the Sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the Sphere is suppressed.\n\nNote that there's no dynamic movement or dynamic extensions for spell effects (movement typically happen as a discrete point at the start of a casters turn); AMF would leave the ForceCage active, just partially disabled where the the caster's sphere is covering it.\n2. Self\nA final note of its uncancellability; two AMFs do not cancel out each other. Their \"sphere of influence\" simply become their union.\n\nAMF: the spheres created by different antimagic field Spells don't nullify each other.\n\n3. Anything\nBy the heuristic magic test, I can't think of anything short of a Wish that could aid in removing an active AMF, and that could still only work from the outside. Even spells like Disintegrate produce a magical effect.\n4. Counterspell\nYou can however, target it at the casting time with Counterspell. It is clearly the lowest level spell that can work, though it has a hard DC, it requires you to have your reaction ready, and it requires the DM being very nice and letting you recognise what spell is being thrown at you (not always the case).\n\nI generally allow identification of the spell as it's being cast (so players can decide whether to counterspell) on a successful Arcana check (DC set by how exposed they have been to the spell).\n\n\nAn sidenote; Wild Shape mentioned earlier, while magical (and AMF-cancellable), is not a spell. Therefore, you cannot target it with Counterspell. Arch druids are fun.\nAntimagic Field Concentration\nDue to its hardline effect; Crawford notes that AMF is intentionally a concentration spell that moves with you, to give the players a chance to take out the mage. In conclusion; don't put it on an item.\nFunny you should mention that. We were just about ready to venture into silly-territory:\nCube of Force\nA cube with 36 fast-recharging charges, and special effects for each face. Simplified flavour text:\n\nYou can use an action to press one of the cube's faces. Each face has a different Effect. A barrier of Invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of Charges.\n\n\nYou can change the barrier's Effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of Charges, resetting the Duration. If your Movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.\n\n\nFace Effects:\n\n1 Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier.\n2 Nonliving matter can't pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.\n3 Living matter can't pass through the barrier. (FC--)\n4 Spell Effects can't pass through the barrier. (AMF--)\n5 Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. (AMF-- + FC--)\n6 The barrier deactivates.\n\nThere's also a strange mechanic for number of chargers and a possibility of depleting it by hitting the barrier with certain high-levels spells, but this is not really relevant here.\nYou'll note how much more loosely worded this is. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation, it does not reference any spells it may mimic (unlike the Beholders Antimagic Cone), and thus these 8 word sentences are all we got. I noted what spells each face comes closest to in the list above, but a lot of questions ultimately arise:\nQuestions\n1. Gas as in state of matter?\nMeaning you could toss in a brick of liquid nitrogen and let it sublimate. How much of physics is valid in D&amp;D?\nNo new breathable air goes in, incidentally. This shouldn't matter much other than if they spend more than an hour inside of the bubble; like spending an hour in a cramped, unventilated meeting room.\n1. Is cloudkill a gas?\nThe Cloudkill gas is a magical effect that drops with Concentration, so it's not matter per se;\n\n{living matter} ∪ {non-living matter} ≠ Multiverse;\nMagical effects are neither.\n\nThus, this wording wouldn't be enough to stop the first example people think of.\n2. Non-living matter?\nThis is probably meant as an Undead shield, but be careful; a dead body still has living parts on it like cells and bacteria. You probably wouldn't want pass this barrier over the corpse of your friends if you want an easy resurrection.\n3. Living matter?\nThis sounds like ForceCage, but without the spell protection. You can protect yourself against arrows and charging enemies, but you cannot shoot out. You might just be trapped inside while enemies outside could target you with spells (or teleport inside).\n4. Spell effects passing through?\nThis one is hard. The wording of passing through is strange - as D&amp;D spell movement is discrete - but presumably any spell effects that crosses the boundary would probably fail to have that effect on the inside, kind of like AMF - but this does not specify that it functions like AMF.\nIn fact it only says the effect itself, it does not limit spells being cast inside, or targetting from the outside. In this case it's actually the inverse of FC; spells can actually traverse the boundary, just effects can not. A caster could step 1ft out of the cube, cast fireball inside, remain undamaged while the inside would be a closed fire chamber.\nThis of course raises a lot more questions, but read on first.\n5. Nothing?\nAll matter, light, magical effects, spell effects, other forces. This is a real cage. You can't hear or see anything from the outside, and can relax in your (very visible) Sensory Deprivation. Incidentally, it is omniphobic; bad guys could just move it with Telekinesis. Bring this cube into a lava pool, then just wait for it to expire. It's not like anyone inside would know.\nThis is dumb\nThis interpretation is clearly strange, but it's the most consistent with the remainder of antimagic AFAIKT. The item is just too ambiguous; the wording does not match anything else in the otherwise pretty consistent spell list.\nThe way we judged this in 2018 looks nothing like the above list, but our original interpretation also did not work out with respect to game balance.\nCrawford noted in the interview that he was actually recommending the removal of AMF for 5th edition, as it just has too many corner cases. Clearly, it was too iconic to remove and Wizards have done a reasonable job of tackling the ambiguities that follow from it, but for the Cube of Force? The silence speaks volumes.\nJust don't use this item. If you want this type of Legendary power, homebrew something using existing spells, but equally, don't relieve a mage of antimagic concentration. Here's an alternative - yet still very poweful - homebrew item:\n\nUmberlee's Upheaval\nA legendary spell casters focus. You can cast the following spells once per day from the following list of spells. The sphere will maintain concentration on one spell at a time, until it has been made to drop it via a command word or if the item is dropped;\n\nHallow (centered on the focus)\nBlade Barrier (ringed wall around focus)\nFreedom of Movement (20ft sphere around focus affecting everyone inside)\n\nThe focus is always the center of the spell. Attunement required by a cleric.\nIs this good?\nThis is clearly very different; filled with largely protective/utility spells, modified to work in AOE around the focus. They all have well-defined use cases, and are all sufficiently different that they are all worth using. While it's still a bit half-baked on my end; compared to the Cube of Force? Easy substitute.\n\nEnding thoughs\nIf you've followed me through this rabbit hole in fantasy rule research, congratulations. Hope this has been interesting. At the very least, I will feel a little more confident in running high level games that may or may not contain liches.\n","description":"A lesson from weakly typed magic items","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2020-10-04-antimagic-revisited/","title":"Antimagic and Force Cubes"},"https://clux.dev/post/2021-02-28-kube-evolution/":{"body":"After a quarter year of extensive improvements to kube, it's time to take a birds-eye view of what we got, and showcase some of the recent improvements. After all, it's been about 40 kube releases, one major version of tokio, one extremely prolific new contributor, and one kubecon talk since my (very outdated) last blog post.\n\nCrates\nAs of 0.51.0, With modules and crates now delineated better, there's now multiple crates in the repository:\n\nkube: Api types, and Client library with from a Config\nkube-derive: proc-macro to derive CustomResource necessities from a struct\nkube-runtime: stream based controller runtime\n\nToday, we will focus on kube.\nkube::Api\nLet's start with the basic feature you'd expect from a client library, the Api.\nIts goals:\n\nallow interaction with any kubernetes resource\nstay compatible with any struct from k8s-openapi\ndefer IO handling to the injected Client\nmap Client output through serde\n\nWe make this generic by making two assumptions about kubernetes:\n\nall objects have metadata from apimachinery/meta/types\nclient-go api generation is generics in disguise (generated api)\n\nWe won't cover this now, but you can watch the talk from KubeCon2020: The Hidden Generics in Kubernetes' API (or read the slides).\nOur Api has been remarkably stable over the past year, despite the internals being restructured heavily.\nOne improvement is to the ergonomics of patching, which now has a typed Patch enum for selecting the patch type.\nDespite full support, we always advocate for server-side apply everywhere as a lot of the awkward issues with local patching are generally swept under the rug with the clearly superior patch mode present in newer versions of kubernetes.\nHere's how patching looks today:\n\nThe biggest Api improvement recently was the inclusion of the most complicated subresources: Api::exec and Api::attach, and these actually uses a different protocol; websockets.\nDespite the complexities, these details have ended up being generally invisible to the user; you can hit Api::exec like any other method, and you'll get the expected streams you can pipe from and pipe to:\nkube master: optional websocket support for exec/attach with @tokio_rs 1.0. Pipe streams to/from k8s pods. pic.twitter.com/WhSFlPmm60— eirik ᐸ'aᐳ (@sszynrae) January 4, 2021 \nkube::Config\nNot to be confused with the file in your home directory, our Config is actually just the relevant parameters we extract from the kubeconfig file (or cluster evars when in-cluster), to help us create a Client.\nYou generally won't need to instantiate any of these though, nor do you need a Config (as shown above), because Client::try_default will infer the correct one.\nRecent updates to stay compatible with the different config variants which kubectl supports, means we now support stacked kubeconfigs, and multi-document kubeconfigs.\nkube::Client\nOne of the most updated parts of kube this year, the Client has undergone significant surgery.\nIt is now entirely concerned with the protocol, and handles the serialization plumbing between the Api and the apiserver.\nMany improvements are only really appreciable internally;\n\n\nwatch buffering is now using a tokio codec to give us a much more readable streaming event parser, while still returning a TryStream&lt;Item = Result&lt;WatchEvent&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt; for Api::watch\n\n\nClient::connect added to give a way to hyper::upgrade an existing http connection (wtf is upgrading?) to grant a streaming websocket connection from the existing http library. This is the secret sauce behind Api::exec.\n\n\nWebsockets is using tokio-tungstenite, a dependency so light-weight it's only pulling in tungstenite without its default-features. Crucially, this lets us avoid having yet another way to specify tls stacks and cause a corresponding explosion of features (weak-dep-features plz).\nOf course, supporting multiple protocols, tls stacks, and certs from kubeconfigs means that there's considerable tls handling in kube. Fortunately, we have mostly managed to confine it to one cursed file.\n..And if websocket support was not enough:\n\nEvery api call now goes through Client::send's new Service, rather than reqwest::send, and we no longer depend on reqwest.\n\nkube::Service\nThe new Service - injected into the Client, and constructed from an arbitrary Config - is what actually deals with the processing of the request call to turn it into a response.\nThe Service creates a series of ordered layers to be executed for each request:\n\nAuthentication (extracting tokens, possibly talking to auth providers)\nUrl + header mapping from Config to http request\nDealing with optional compression\nSend it to a HyperClient configured with a Connector\n\nThe connector for hyper deals with TLS stack selection + Timeouts + proxying\nWhy this abstraction? Well, primarily, less entangling business logic with IO (Sans-IO goals), and tower provides a robust way to move in that direction.\nThere's also code-reuse of common service layers (effectively middleware), as well as the ability to mock services out of the box, something that will help create a better mocking setup down the line.\nFor now, however, the end result is a more light-weight http client: hyper over reqwest, and without changing the core api boundaries (inserting Service between Client and Config will not affect the vast majority of users who use Client::try_default as the main start point).\nCredits\nIf you looked at the contributors graph, you'll see we have a new maintainer.\nHow did their contributions spike so quickly? Well, check out the prs for tower + hyper rearchitecture, and websocket support. Imagine landing those hugely ambitious beasts so quickly, and still managing to merge 20+ more prs since january 🤯\n...So, having mostly project-managered the ship the past two months, it's important to give due credit while we appreciate how far we've come. Huge thanks to kazk.\nIn fact, from the client capabilities document, we are almost at .\nEnd\nTL;DR: A lot has happened. We have dissected parts of kube.\nAs a kind of conclusion, I would just like to note how much easier these complex problems are to tackle in rust now thanks to tokio.rs. The ecosystem is fantastic now.\nFuture Addendum\nSome key kube related issues that I personally hope will be resolved in 2021:\n\nergonomics / utils\ntesting / mocking\ntracing story\ndyn api improvements\nless Options in generated types\n\nWithout being able to give any guarantees. Volunteer work, you know.\nSpeaking of; help is instrumental for moving things forward, and always appreciated. Even if you are just fixing docs / examples or asking questions.\nCheck our discussions, the tokio discord, or the issues if interested. Take care ✨🤗\n","description":"Tower, Hyper, Websockets.","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2021-02-28-kube-evolution/","title":"Evolution of kube"},"https://clux.dev/post/2021-11-06-kubecon-la-log/":{"body":"First KubeCon in a while I haven't done anything for (didn't even buy an ticket).

This week marked our retrospective, and the release of several relics of the campaign. One in particular was the campaign repo - previously described as my foaming campaign brain. This is a brief post about the setup, and discovered pros/cons associated with it.\n\nCampaign\nCampaign first. We held 126 sessions about the campaign over 3.5 years (i.e. 36 per 12 months) as a remarkably consistent group (even after the pandemic hit and we moved remote).\nTooling also moved on; discord + Avreae (dndbeyond character + dice integration), rhythm for music (got DMCA'd and replaced by jmusicbot), owlbear.rodeo for interactive maps, 5e.tools for quick spell/item/monster searches and more. A lot easier to run with your main computer in front of you.\nWe could also record with OBS. So in fact, from the pandemic on, I started gathering episodes in an unlisted youtube playlist. Mainly as a reference, but also a memento later, for when it was over.\nInlining an external embed here to the wrap-up episode below.\n\n    \n\n\npart 2 here.\nThis could be interesting if you want to cross reference with navigation in the brain / want to see how the tools fit together (map top left, discord dice bot bottom left), or you were a previous player (I don't assume it would be super interesting to anyone else).\nIt's also the only episode where the DM is relieved throughout the entire episode (because we managed to finish the campaign and they didn't all wipe 16 levels in).\nAnyway. Onto the notes.\nThe Brain\nI had started to use foam as a note taking tool in 2020. Mostly because of my familiarity with Markdown, but also the avoidance of vendor lock-in. Go read foaming campaign brain for more reasons behind this and how it works.\nIt's very similar to obsidian, and most of the general advice for it applies.\nThe structure is just one enormous docs folder with markdown documents that is haphazardly grouped into folders:\n\nThese refer to either collections of notes that were close in time/space across the campaign, or special sets of notes like pcs, npcs, factions, and dm notes and rules.\nThe documents in these folders cross-link with various markdown plugins in VS Code (using wiki syntax). Users could clone and open the campaign repo with VS Code, install plugins, and you would get my experience, but this is a bit awkward.\nI couldn't just give people a link to things in the docs (e.g. goatweaver) because you'll notice none of the wikilinks work. So we needed a webpage conversion.\nRelease Solution\nThanks to this template repo, it was reasonable easy to glue together\nmkdocs with the mkdocs-material theme. The result is this:\n\nFolders become tabs, files becomes entries on the left side, and TOC is generated from headers on the right. Images are rendered from disk (as in markdown preview), cross-links work, and it would have ended up looking super professional had it not been for the myriad of TODOs buried in every document.\nYou can view the resulting static website at your leisure, but again, this is not going to be very interesting for anyone except the players and other DMs.\nWhat Worked Well\nRunning The Game\nIt was very nice process to DM with code in front of me. Definitely much better than the original OneNote setup that was periodically down or slow to respond. Knowing how to search, and cycle through tabs, and search within docs (or use rg in the docs folder) made it very easy to find anything quickly (no matter how deeply buried it ended up).\nYour mileage may vary on this point, but if you know how to use a code editor, you'll always end up with a more powerful way to navigate than whatever features that eventually make it into notion et al.\nWebsite Release\nIt took me about one day to reorganise the repo in a way that it worked with mkdocs. The process was basically:\n\nmove content into a docs/ subfolder\nimport template repo as a base\nre-remember how to install shit with python\nfix broken links that mkdocs serve found\ntweak mkdocs.yml to\n\nmake the theme look good and add dark mode\nchoose the most sensible navigation setups (mkdocs-material has many)\nmake edit links work (takes you to a github edit view that eventually leads to a branch commit or a fork pr)\n\n\n\nThe mkdocs-material docs in general were fantastic. Live preview of the features from their dogfooding setup. While I am confident an approximation exists with hugo, the features and quality here went far beyond anything I have seen in this space:\n\nSearch / ajax fetching / edit links on page / multiple TOC generation methods\n\nIt made the outcome very attractive looking. In fact, it's so nice that it might even replace the rust mdbook tool as a default simple static markdown web page for me.\n(.. well. Maybe anyway. The python ecosystem still leaves a lot to be desired.)\nRecap Writing\nBasically, a quick Ctrl-Shift-P in code, ask foam to create my preferred note (by hijacking the daily note setup for this), and it fills in the basics.\nThis file would serve as the \"last we left off\" at the start of each session, plus notes and TODOs for myself.\nImage Pasting\nThe paste-image plugin was pretty easy for capturing images and associating it quickly with the document. I would have preferred a drag and drop (when it could have worked), but ultimately bound a button in my desktop environment to do quickly draw a rectangle on my screen and shunt its contents to my clipboard (which then could be pasted from the plugin without going through a temporary file).\nFoam Improvements\nThroughout half their release history, nothing major broke on my end as plugins upgraded.\nThe most notable upgrade I noticed was the complete revamp of the graph view with new selection features:\n\nHowever, one minor snag in one upgrade was hiding the recaps from the graph view. EDIT 2023 workaround found.\nWhat Sucked\nRenames\nFoam still struggled with doing file renames (because backlinks were not updated). This was worked around to some extent thanks to mkdocs telling me about the broken links (but this was after adding the web page element).\nYou are really dissuaded from renaming files either way (because of the work it leads to), and it basically precludes doing bigger refactors at the moment.\nIt's probably™ implementable on their side \"without too much work\"© (because you can probably work around this with a script + sed if you are masochistic enough), but ultimately, someone has to actually do it - and who knows what complexity lurks within vs code plugins.\nEDIT: Have commented out this part in 2023 because this issue was resolved in foam.\nSort Inconsistencies\nMy recaps folder has two digits prefixes on every note. This was fine in my file viewer + vs code, but not in mkdocs-material which sorted the entries lexicographically. Renaming would have to be done with sed or some other bulk search/replace tool.\nThis meant we basically had to take the folder contents and manually arrange them. This wasn't too annoying, as we could just copy the output from fd .md . in the docs folder, and it was nice to be able to customize sorting anyway.\nWorld Secrets\nIf you want to release a DM brain (with all your plans and secrets) from your campaing, you are more or less saying that this world over. This was ok for us, it's been almost 4 years, and it's not particularly original (forgotten realms, and stolen content everywhere). If you wanted to do a Mercer style campaign procession where each season is set in the same world different area, then this process becomes difficult.\nIf you have a team of software people familiar with an editor you could have a player brain type thing that you could reference from the DM brain potentially. But if you have their level of viewers or players dedicated enough to basically write a wiki for your campaign, maybe you have bigger problems.\nGraph View Not Exported\nThere maybe some way of exporting the graph into a json blob and importing it in a separate page for users to browse (like a sitemap). But given how much graph has changed and is going to change, plus my impatience for real web development made this a non-starter.\nConclusion\nFoam worked really well for this type of scoped project. I actually think that this type of brain would also work well for the players (if you have an engineer or two to manage it as notes) because they benefit much more from the website searchability, and you don't run into the last problem about world secrets.\nLacking that, I will probably carry on with this setup for any similar ttrpg setup. Most of the negatives listed above are a bit nitpicky (EDIT: and resolved now), and are generally not that problematic. Plus, I now have a better idea of what structures work (pcs, npcs, factions, deities, recaps were perfect fits for their own folders), what information ought to go where, and how deep to go.\nHowever, this comes with a heavy caveat. This is currently best for small scale projects with a sense of finality. If this was my life brain, I would be a bit worried about the renaming problem (\"would I never be able to refactor this?\"). On the other hand, they have an issue for it and have been doing promising development. EDIT 2023: The rename problem is resolved, and I am using this for my main brain as well now.\nConsidering the standard open source software tradeoff is often between:\n\nfree + a bit janky &lt;------------&gt; costly + vendor-locked\n\nFoam does not deviate too far from this. It's good, and it can become great.\n..and you have VS Code on your side to help tilt the tradeoff\n","description":"..and more reasons (not) to pay for Notion","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2021-12-05-campaign-concluded/","title":"Campaign Conclusion & Brain Dump"},"https://clux.dev/post/2022-01-11-prometheus-ecosystem/":{"body":"As part of my work life in the past year, a chunk of my day-to-day life has consisted of maintaining a prometheus installation on top of a sizable kubernetes cluster. My original feeling was \"this is not that bad with kube-prometheus-stack\", but this sentiment has worsened somewhat with the realisation that more and more customizations and pieces were needed for large scale use. Half a year later (and 6+ charts deep), I thought I'd collect my thoughts on the ecosystem - from an operational perspective - with a rough architecture overview post.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nInformation here is based on my own learnings. Some details might be wrong. Please submit an issue / fix if you see anything glaring.\nThis post uses the classical open source prometheus setup with HA pairs and thanos on top. There are other promising setups such as agent mode with remote write.\nWe are following the most-standard helm approach and using charts directly (i.e. avoiding direct use of jsonnet)\n\nYou can debate the last point, but if you are optimizing for user-editability of the prometheus-stack, then jsonnet is kind of the opposite of that - particularly when the rest of the cloud is installed with helm.\nArchitecture Overview\nThe TL;DR image. Open it up in a new tab, and cycle between if you want to read about specific components below.\n\nLegend:\n\nuser components and the user read path is green\nprometheus/thanos write path is red.\nhelm charts are denoted with thick dashed lines\narrows flow from the instigator of the verb to the object acted upon\n\nDeveloper Interaction\nA user / developer on a kubernetes cluster with the prometheus stack installed can be expected to:\n\ndevelop applications with hpas and have them scraped by prometheus for metrics\ncreate dashboards in grafana and save them as ConfigMap entries\ncreate alerting rules to be triggered when metrics exceed thresholds (and maybe even tweak existing mixins)\nquery metrics directly on grafana's explore and thanos's queryfrontend\n\n..and the user should not have to know too much about the complicated spaghetti setup that this diagram might give a scary impression of.\nPart 1: kube-prometheus-stack\nThe blue dashed line represents a set of components that are commonly deployed together on kubernetes due to their interdependence, and these are managed together in the kube-prometheus-stack helm chart.\nIt is a ~3k LOC yaml values file with a further 71k LOC of yaml in that chart folder alone (what could go wrong), and it configures the following components:\n\nprometheus\nalertmanager\nprometheus-operator\ngrafana\nkube-state-metrics\nnode-exporter\nkubernetes specific monitors\nmonitoring mixins\n\n24k lines here are just the absolutely massive prometheus-operator crds (that are now too big to apply), but it's still an astonishing amount of yaml. Typically you'll end up with between 20-40k (excluding the crds) with a 100-500 line values file that you have to maintain (you generally don't want your values file to be too large as it becomes harder and harder to keep track of the breaking changes in the stringly typed helm chart apis).\nprometheus\nThe octopus at the base of our architecture. Prometheus scrapes the metrics endpoints of virtually every application you have, stores the data locally in a low-retention (a week or two) time series database that you can query. (The grey scrape arrows are illustrative, whereas they would usually hit everything, and also hit it from every prometheus pod in the statefulset for redundancy).\nIt also continually computes configured evaluation rules, and raises alerts on configured metric thresholds.\nPrometheus is over 9 years old, and has graduate maturity in cncf.\nIn theory, you can run it directly, tell it to scrape this-and-this and be done, but that will lead to downtime quickly. You are going to need at least two replicas for failover, and these are going to need mounted volumes to store their data. A StatefulSet in kubernetes.\nFor configuration; how to scrape metrics can be tweaked through a mounted scrape_config (a pretty complicated yaml DSL using snake_case). If you get the syntax wrong, prometheus hates your config and won't boot. promtool can validate it.\n\nThis config is pretty awful to write and debug manually, so imo, you should probably avoid writing it yourself (see the operator below).\nConsider importing the semi-standardised prometheus.io/scrape ones from the main prometheus chart if you wish (they slightly clash with the root chart), but those should be it. Scrape config also needs you to inline secrets, so not great from a security perspective.\nAlerting and recording rules are similarly configured and has same caveats (don't write them manually).\nalertmanager\nAlerts (the data in the special ALERTS{alertstate=\"firing\"} metric) are sent from prometheus to alertmanager.\n\nAt least, this is usually what happens. The communication to and within alertmanager is probably the most annoying parts of this entire architecture.\nA problem that keeps biting me is how prometheus can lose track of alertmanager ips, and fail to send alerts for hours. There are many issues related to this.\nWhen alerts do actually get passed to alertmanager, they go through a pretty complicated internal architecture, before ultimately being sent to configured receivers. Alertmanager contains deduplication mechanisms, and a custom UDP &amp; TCP gossip protocol (that keeps breaking in HA setups - causing duplicate alerts).\nThe built-in receivers for slack/pagerduty seem to handle deduplicating alerts themselves, so if you can get by without HA and don't need a custom webhook, you might be ok.\nStill, your mileage will definitely vary with this component.\nAlertmanager is almost 9 years old, has 2 maintainers, and is a sub-project of the prometheus org.\nprometheus-operator\nA system that sits on top of prometheus, and extends the configuration with the large monitoring.coreos.com CRDs. This operator watches these CRDs, validates them via admission, converts them to a prometheus compatible format, and injects them into the running prometheus via a config-reloader sidecar on the prometheus statefulset. The most commonly used configuration CRDs are PrometheusRule and ServiceMonitor.\nThis setup avoids you taking down prometheus when you/users write new or invalid configuration or alerts. It also provides a mechanism for referencing kubernetes Secret objects (avoiding encryption needs on the base configuration), and it is generally considered the standard abstraction for configuring prometheus scraping.\nA minor, but debatable choice they have made, is to re-map the scrape_config keys to camelCase forcing you have to write half of your ServiceMonitor in camelCase (the keys), and the other half in snake_case (the values):\n\nThe operator configures prometheus, alertmanager, and optionally also thanos ruler.\nIt is over 5 years old and considered beta. It's maintained by people who are mostly disjoint from the the prometheus maintainers. I.e. while this is not a first-class supported thing from prometheus, everyone uses it - and it is well-documented.\ngrafana\nWhile prometheus does have sufficient querying functionality built in, it does not let you save these queries other than by a long-ass url, so realistically, users will want Grafana for dashboards and cool panel customization.\nThe key strength of Grafana lies in how it becomes the one-stop shop for querying &amp; visualising anything when you buy into the ecosystem, and the huge amount of data sources they have available:\n\nanything prometheus-like\ncloudwatch\nhoneycomb\ntempo\nloki\nelastic\nsentry\n\n..plus tons more that you are less likely to run into (cloudwatch shown as one common case). Even if you only use if it against prometheus, it's still a generally painless component to install with tons of benefits.\nGrafana is packaged as a small-ish grafana-maintained helm chart, which is pinned as a subchart under kube-prometheus-stack.\nThe chart contains some nice ways of making dashboard provisioning automatic (dashboards as configmaps), but this comes with its own pain points:\n\nneed to verify dashboard json out-of-band (validity + uid presence)\ndashboards incur k8s size limits - 1MB on ConfigMap, 256kB applied annotation\nHA setups could split brain dashboards with partial saves (seems fixed now)\nprovisioned dashboards are incompatible with built-in alerts\nfuture dashboard-as-code direction is very undecided\n\nRegardless, the diagram shows how the user flow would be for this, and how it ends up being picked up by a sidecar in the grafana statefulset.\nAddendum: Governance &amp; Grafana Labs Sidenotes\nGrafana has a more company driven governance model - it's maintained almost exclusively by people employed by Grafana Labs - and the company is clearly optimizing for their own cloud offering of a parallel subset of this ecosystem; Grafana Cloud.\nThis obvious conflict of interest does pollute the purity of ecosystem somewhat, but at least they have financing to move at the great pace they are moving. Some examples of their recent efforts:\n\nloki - a serious elastic contender for logs that integrates with grafana\ntempo - a super clean tracing backend that integrates with grafana\nwell maintained helm charts for grafana/tempo/loki\nprometheus agent mode\n\nOf course, there is the expectation that open source functionality not related to grafana cloud might be receiving less attention, but I can't really blame them for pursuing a sensible monetisation strategy.\nI do hope Grafana OnCall manages to get something contributed upstream (outside the grafana monolith) so we can have a better alternative to alertmanager (as alertmanager has lots of issues and can only alert on prometheus data sources).\n\nMonitoring Mixins\nA default grafana/prometheus-operator installation is not going to be very helpful without some dashboards that tell you about the state of your system(s).\nCommon patterns for alerts/dashboards/recording rules are encapsulated in a collection of mixins that are browsable on monitoring.mixins.dev.\nThe kubernetes-mixin stands out in particular, providing excellent, high maturity, drill-down-linked dashboards that are going to be vital for a large percentage of kubernetes related incidents.\nIn general, these provide a great starting point for most clusters (despite sometimes being overly noisy). You likely have to re-configure some thresholds, and remove some of these alerts as you see fit you your production cluster, but the defaults are generally intelligent.\nUnfortunately, there are many operational challenges with these mixins. helm is certainly not best suited to take full advantage of them as not every option is bubbled up to the charts, and these values flow through so many layers it's challenging to find where they truly originate, e.g. kube-prometheus-stack &lt;- kube-prometheus &lt;- prometheus-operator.\nThis often caused me not wanting to bother with fixing it in the first place, which of course leads to the mixins not being as good as they could be. AFAIKT, your options are:\n\nforking the mixins you care about and opting out of automatic upstream fixes\npost-template modifications of minor details with hacky solutions like sed/jq\nmanaging mixins out-of-band, aligning implicit default values with the charts, and customizing with jsonnet\ngoing through the drudgery of propagating mixin fixes through several repos\n\nWhile I advocate for trying to propagate fixes when motivation strikes, forking mixins at least makes your yaml readable in your gitops repo, so it's actually a decent option - particularly given how awful the other solutions are.\nRegardless, it's another useful, but imperfect component that you are going to need.\nMetric Sources\nWe move on to the components that create most of your data in prometheus.\nUsing the mixins (or equivalent dashboards) effectively requires you having standard kubernetes metric sources configured (otherwise you will have missing values in all your mixin dashboards).\nWe will briefly run through these metric sources, focusing first on the ones that appear in the kube-prometheus-stack. In general, these are pretty-well behaved and low-maintenance, so there won't be too much to say about these.\nnode-exporter\nThe main external metric source. A prometheus org maintained DaemonSet component that scrapes system level unix metrics. It mounts /, /sys, and /proc - with hostPID and hostNetwork enabled - to grab extensive information about each node.\nIt's a sub-chart of kube-prometheus-stack, and it has a slew of configurable exporters, which can be configured from the chart, but the defaults from kube-prometheus-stack are likely good enough.\nkube-state-metrics\nThe second stand-alone metric exporter for kubernetes. Maintained by kubernetes itself; kube-state-metrics is a smaller deployment that generates metrics from what it sees the state of objects are from the apiserver. It has client-go reflectors and uses the results of their long watches to populate metrics.\nIt's a conceptually pretty simple piece; an api -&gt; metrics transformer, but kubernetes has a lot of apis, so definitely not something you want to write yourself.\nIn example terms; this component provides the base data for what you need to answer the questions like whether your:\n\n\"Pod has been in an unhealthy state for &gt;N minutes\"\n\"Deployment has failed to complete its last rollout in N minutes\"\n\"HorizontalPodAutoscaler has been maxed out for &gt;N minutes\"\n\n..stuff that you can figure out with kubectl get -oyaml.\nKSM is deployed via an in-tree subchart under kube-prometheus-stack.\nYou can configure what apis it provides metrics for under collectors.\nAddendum: Label configuration caveat\nThe only issue I've run into with KSM is that the metric labels are often insufficient for integration with existing standard alerting setups (problem being that the generic alerts from kubernetes-mixin will fire, but it's hard to tell by the name of the deployment alone who should get that alert). This can be rectified with the metricLabelsAllowlist in the chart, e.g.:\n\nto inject more labels (here app) from the root object onto metrics. Annoyingly, these only get injected into an informational _labels metric, so you'd have to extend kubernetes-mixin with big joins to get these values exposed in the alert:\n\n\nkubernetes internal sources\nFor poking at the internals of kubernetes, you can enable configurable scrapers for:\n\nkubelet\nkube-apiserver\nkube-controller-manager\nkube-scheduler\nkube-proxy\ncoreDns or kubeDns\netcd\n\nThere is some sparse documentation for these under kubernetes/cluster-admin.\nThese are a little more optional, but you need the kubelet metrics (via cadvisor), for the main kubernetes mixins, so make sure those are enabled.\nThe more superfluous ones that come with the kube-apiserver (particularly the burnrate stuff) are particularly heavy evaluation rules (saw a ~6 cores reduction after removing them from one busy prometheus pair). Imo, you probably only need some of these if you are a cloud provider.\nExtra metrics exporters\nAny additional metrics exporters are not part of the kube-prometheus-stack chart, but there are tons of exporters availble supported by the same prometheus-community, so would expect them to be of high quality based on their commit history and repository CI, but have otherwise not enough experience here.\nPart 2: Thanos\nBefore this step, you can have a pretty self-contained prometheus stack where grafana's default data source would point at the prometheus' Service, and metrics would fade out after prometheus' retention period.\nThanos essentially takes all the components that's found inside prometheus, and allows you to deploy and scale them separately, while providing a prometheus compatible API for long term storage of metrics.\nIt relies on data being sent from any prometheus set - via a sidecar on prometheus (configurable via the kube-prometheus-stack chart) - to some provisioned object storage (here S3).\nThe write paths to the S3 bucket is highlighted in red on the diagram.\nThe various read paths are highlighted in green on the diagram, and show how various types of reads propagate to various systems (grafana is the normal entrypoint, but the query-frontend is also a nice way to debug thanos specifics closer to the source).\nThe thanos configuration is \"almost\" completely contained in the thanos chart (of your choice) and is marked with a dashed purple square.\n\n\"almost\": S3 configuration is also needed in kube-prometheus-stack for writing\n\nThere are several charts that are trying to package the same thing for thanos:\n\nbitnami/thanos - most active\nbanzai/thanos - pretty inactive\nthanos-community/helm-charts - \"official\", but clearly abandoned/out-of-date\n\nThey all have problems:\n\nbitnami ties itself to its own ecosystem, and is not based on the official jsonnet\nbanzai is clearly outdated\nthanos-community charts lacks developers (and they see helm users as a minority)\n\nSo far, the bitnami chart is the most appropriate for helm users.\nIt's an evolving ecosystem with many components, but none of them are as complicated to operate as the kube-prometheus-stack components (and there seems to be a lot less footguns).\nThanos is an incubating cncf project that is just over 4 years old. It has a healthy set of maintainers, it moves fast, and makes some of the most well-documented, high-quality releases out there.\nWhile it's not trivial to maintain - the large cpu/memory usage and scaling profiles presents some challenges - it has generally not presented major problems.\nA quick run-through of things worth knowing about the components follows:\nThanos Query Frontend\nThe http UI users can use. Very light-weight. The Service for this Deployment generally becomes the default user substitute way to query anything (instead of going to a prometheus service's web interface - which after installing thanos is mostly useful for debugging scrape configs).\nIt also looks almost exactly like the prometheus web interface (sans ability to debug scrape targets).\nThis proxies all traffic to thanos query and never breaks.\nThanos Query\nThe big fan-out engine that fetches query data from one or more metric sources (typically thanos store + prometheus services), and computes the result of your query on the retrieved data.\nThis component will suddenly spike in both CPU and memory when it's under heavy load (i.e. users doing big queries), so an HPA here on CPU works OK - albeit some stabilization values might be useful:\n\nThe compute workload kubernetes-mixin dashboard will show roughly how this HPA reacts to changes (stacked view, colors represent pods):\n\nwhich lines up with the thanos_query_concurrent_gate_queries_in_flight metric reasonably well.\nThanos Store\nThe read interface to long term storage. It's also prometheus api compatible (using the Store API), so from the querier's POV it is analogous to querying a prometheus.\nThis component also will also suddenly spike in both CPU and memory when users start doing big queries on historical data (i.e. further back in time than prometheus' retention), so a similar HPA to thanos query to scale on CPU works reasonably well:\n\nThanos Ruler\nAn optional rule evaluation / alerting analogue.\nThis is a bit more niche than the rule evaluation in prometheus itself, because rule evalution on the prometheus side essentially gets stored as metrics in the long term storage. The only reason you need this is if you need to alert on / create evaluation rules on a federated level (e.g. to answer whether you have a high error rate across all production clusters / prometheus sets).\nIf you need the alerting part, then you have another component that talks to alertmanager 🙃.\nCan run in a stateful mode - presenting a prometheus compatible store api that the querier can hit for rule results - or statelessly; persisting rule results to s3.\nThanos Compactor\nThe magic sauce that makes querying long term data practical - as raw data is too resource intensive to use when you want to view result over the past weeks or months.\nThe compactor will go through the S3 bucket, and create lower-res data (at 5m averages and 1h averages), and delete raw data (after a configurable time has passed).\nOne such configuration can be:\n\nMaintain raw resolution for 7d\nCreate 5m resolution chunks that are kept for 30d\nCreate 1h resolution chunks that are kept for 1y\n\nThe compactor will chug along and do these in steps (creating 5m res from raw, then creating 1h res from 5m res), as the chunks become available.\nLong-term, the lower res data is more practical to both query and store, but you end up with multiple variants of the data in the first 7 to 30 days.\nIf this is hard to visualize, then fear not, you can browse to thanos bucket web to visualise the state of your S3 bucket. It's a small service (included in the chart) that presents the view, and what resolutions are availble from various dates.\nThink of compactor as a cronjob (but with good alerts) that needs to do big data operations. If you give it enough space, cpu, and memory it is usually happy. It will use these resources a bit sporadically though - some cycles are clearly visible in memory use:\n\nPart 3: Metrics API Integrations\nThe final components reside in the void outside the two big standard charts and contains the implementors of the various metrics apis:\n\nresource metrics api (cpu/memory for pods)\ncustom metrics api (metrics related to a scalable object)\nexternal metrics api (metrics unrelated to a scalable object)\n\nThese are apis that allow Kubernetes to scale your workloads (with varying degrees of intelligence) through HPAs, but you need something to implement them.\nI mention these different underlying apis explicitly because currently you can only have one implementor of each api, and if you have more than one thing that provides custom metrics (like say cloudwatch metrics + prometheus adapter), then you are better served by using KEDA than what is described herein.\nmetrics-server\nThe first is a kubernetes standard component; the metrics-server.\nIt only implements the resource metrics api, and thus only enables you scale on cpu and memory.\nIt extracts cpu/memory values values via kubelet, and as such allows kubectl top + HPAs to work out of the box - without prometheus or any of the other components visualised herein. It's even installed on k3d by default.\nprometheus-adapter\nThis adapter funnels metrics from prometheus into the HPA universe, so you can scale on arbitrary metrics.\nIt implements the resource metrics, custom metrics, and external metrics APIs. The underlying setup for this has stable docs from k8s 1.23, and in essence this allows you to scale on custom metrics (related to the scaling object) or external metrics (unrelated to the scaling object).\nThe syntax needed for this component definitely leaves a lot to be desired. The only way we have managed to get somewhere with this is with principal engineers and a lot of trial and error. Thankfully, there are some helpful resources, this is still not easy.\nThe repository for prometheus-adapter is also not receiving a whole of attention: almost half of their closed issues looks like they were closed by kubernetes org's auto-closer bot. You can say many sensible things about this closing practice - on the importance of funding and triagers for open source software - but it ultimately sends a message:\nUnpopular opinion: I think solving issue triage by letting robots auto close issues that were never responded to is a *horrible* way to manage your project and tells users you don't give a crap about their effort filing bugs :(— Benjamin Elder (@BenTheElder) June 23, 2021 \nIt does have its own prometheus-community maintained chart, which is of high quality, but you will need to figure out the templated promql yourself.\nWithout having much experience with KEDA, I would recommend looking into using KEDA's prometheus scaler directly instead of using the arcane template magic from prometheus-adapter.\nHappy new year\nThat's all I can bring myself to write about this archeticture for now. It took longer than I anticipated, so hopefully this was useful to someone. Regardless, best of luck maintaining prometheus in 2022.\n","description":"operating the stateful metrics system on kubernetes","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2022-01-11-prometheus-ecosystem/","title":"Prometheus Stack Review"},"https://clux.dev/post/2022-04-12-baldurs-roll/":{"body":"In a brief bout of escapism from the world and responsibilities, I booted up Baldur's Gate 2 with my brother. It's an amazing game, once you have figured out how to roll your character.\nFor today's installment; rather than telling you about the game, let's talk about the maths behind rolling a 2e character for BG2, and then running simulations with weird X-based linux tools.\n\n\nRolling a character\nThe BG2 character generation mechanics is almost entirely based on the rules from AD&amp;D 2e. You get 6 ability scores, and each ability score is rolled as the sum of 3d6.\n\nProbablistically; this should give you a character with an expected 63 total ability points (as a result of rolling 18d6).\n\nMechanically, you are in this screen:\n\n...and they have given you a reroll button.\nIt's a strange design idea to port the rolling mechanics from d&amp;d into this game. In a normal campaign you'd usually get one chance rolling, but here, there's no downside to keeping going; encouraging excessive time investment (the irony in writing a blog post on this is not lost on me). The character creation in BG2 would probably have been less perfection focused if they'd gone for something like 5e point buy.\nAnyway, suppose you want learn how to automate this, or you just want to think about combinatorics, multinomials, and weird X tools for a while, then this is the right place. You will also figure out how long it's expected to take to roll high.\n\nHINT: ..it's less time than it took to write this blogpost\n\nDisclaimer\nUsing the script used herein to achieve higher rolls than you have patience for, is on some level; cheating.

We are going to follow the simpler multinomial expansion from mathworld/Dice for s=6 and n=18 and find $P(x, 18, 6)$ which we will denote as $P(X = x)$; the chance of rolling a sum equal to $x$:\n$$P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{6^{18}} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor(x-18)/6\\rfloor} (-1)^k \\binom{18}{k} \\binom{x-6k-1}{17}$$\n$$ = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor(x-18)/6\\rfloor} (-1)^k \\frac{18}{k!(18-k)!} \\frac{(x-6k-1)!}{(x-6k-18)!}$$\nIf we were to expand this expression, we would get 15 different expressions depending on how big of an $x$ you want to determine. So rather than trying to reduce this to a polynomial expression over $p$, we will paste values into wolfram alpha and tabulate for $[18, \\ldots, 108]$.\nYou can see the appendix for the numbers. Here we will just plot the values:\n\n\nand with the precise distribution we can also calculation expectation and variance:\n\n$E(X) = 63$\n$Var(X) = 52.5 \\thickapprox 7.24^2$\n\nThis is how things should look on paper. From the chart you can extract:\n\n108 would be a once in 101 trillion ($6^{18}$) event\n107 would be a once in 5 trillion event (6^18/18)\n106 would be a once in 600 billion event (5s in two places, or 4 in one place)\n105 would be a once in 90 billion event (3x5s, or 1x4 and 1x5, or 1x3)\n104 would be a once in 16 billion event (4x5s, 2x5s and 1x4, 2x4s, 1x5 and 1x3, 1x2)\n103 would be a once in 4 billion event (...)\n102 would be a once in 1 billion event\n101 would be a once in 290 million event\n100 would be a once in 94 million event\n99 would be a once in 32 million event\n$\\ldots$\n95 would be a once in 900k event (first number with prob &lt; 1 in a million)\n\nBut is this really right for BG? A lot of people have all rolled nineties in just a few hundred rolls, and many even getting 100 or more..was that extreme luck, or are higher numbers more likely than what this distribution says?\nWell, let's start with the obvious:\n\nThe distribution is censored. We don't see the rolls below $75$.\n\n\n\nWhat's left of this cutoff actually accounts for around 94% of the distribution. If the game did not do this, you'd be as likely getting 36 as a 90. We are effectively throwing away \"19 bad rolls\" on every roll.\n\nAD&amp;D 2e had its own ways to tilt the distribution in a way that resulted in more powerful characters.\n\nHow such a truncation or censoring is performed is at the mercy of the BG engine. We will rectify the distribution by scaling up the truncated version of our distribution, and show that this is correct later.\n\n\nHere we have divided by the sum of the probabilities of the right hand side of the graph $P(X \\ge 75)$ to get the new probability sum to 1.\nUsing this scaled data, we can get precise, truncated distribution parameters:\n\n$E(X_T) = 77.525$\n$Var(X_T) = 2.61^2$\n\nThis censored 18d6 multinomial distribution is actually very close for certain cases, and we will demonstrate this.\nBut first, we are going to need to press the reroll button a lot...\nAutomating Rolling\nThe simulation script / hacks we made is found here.\nTools\nWe are playing on Linux with X and some obscure associated tooling:\n\nscrot - X screenshot utility\nxdotool - X CLI automation tool\nxwininfo - X window information utility\n\nBasic strategy;\n\nfind out where buttons are with xwininfo\npress the reroll button with xdotool\ntake screenshot of the total number with scrot\ncompare screenshot to previous rolls\npress store when a new maximum is found\n\nThe script also does some extra stuff to determine the strength roll, but that's not relevant here.\nInitialization\nTo standardise what we are taking screenshots of, we need a consistent frame of reference.\nxwininfo will give us the x,y coordinates of the top left corner of the game window, and then hard-code the offsets from that because the game has a consistent layout. There is some complexity in doing this, but it has so far worked well.\n\nCaveat: You need to have scaled the window to size &gt;= 1024x768 to avoid UI downscaling.\n\nThe standardised approach also helps with dealing with rolls, and it let us populate a roll-table quickly.\nRoll Tables\nTaking screenshots is pretty easy. Use scrot at an x,y coordinate followed by lenghts; ,width,height as remaining arguments defining the square to screenshot:\n\nthe output of this can be piped to a .webpwebpd passed to compare (part of imagemagick package), to compare values based on thresholds. However, this idea is actually overkill..\nThe menu background is static and the resulting screenshots are actually completely deterministic per value, so we can instead just compare them by their hashes in one big switch (i.e. after piping to md5) and use that as our roll table, Excerpt:\n\nClicking\nAutomating a click is simply:\n\nwhere the --delay=0 overrides a builtin delay between clicks.\nThe only complication here is that BG performs internal buffering of clicks, so this allows us to blast through numbers faster than the screen can display them. This means we have to compensate with a sleep 0.001 after clicking to ensure we can grab the scrot of the roll before another click is registered.\nShowcase\nRunning the script (with a terminal showing the script output overlayed) looks like this:\n\n    \n\nOn my machine, we get just over 15 rolls per second.\nSampling\nWe rolled a human fighter, paladin, and a ranger overnight with roughly half a million rolls each (see appendix), and we got these values:\n\n\nLet's start with the fighter. If we compare the fighter graph with our precise, censored multinomial distribution, they are very close:\n\n\nSo for fighters, we can be pretty happy with the calculations we have done, and can use the precise probabilities as a guide.\n\nHow long would it take you to achieve &gt;95 for a fighter using the script?\n\n\n108 is a once in 5 trillion event (10,000 years)\n107 is a once in 300 billion event (600 years)\n106 is a once in 33 billion event (69 years)\n105 is a once in 5 billion event (10 years)\n104 is a once in 900 million event (2 years)\n103 is a once in 200 million event (5 months)\n102 is a once in 50 million event (5 weeks)\n101 is a once in 16 million event (2 weeks)\n100 is a once in 5 million event (4 days)\n99 is a once in 2 million event (1.5 day)\n98 is a once in 700k event (12h)\n97 is a once in 270k event (5h)\n96 is a once in 110k event (2h)\n95 is a once in 50k event (55m)\n\nSo if we only look at human fighters or mages, we can stop here:\n\nWe are actually quite a lot more likely to get a good roll early than what just the pure dice math would indicate thanks to censoring (50k rolls =&gt; likely 95 rather than estimated 90 without censoring).\n\nHowever, what's up with the paladins and rangers? Time for a more painful math detour.\n\nClass Variance\nThe reason for the discrepancy is simple: stat floors based on races/class.\nThese stat floors are insignificant in some cases, but highly significant in others. Some highly floored classes actually push the uncensored mean above the 75 cutoff even though it's a whole 12 points above the mean of the original underlying distribution.\nThe floors for a some of the classes:\n\nfighter mins: STR=9, rest 3\nmage mins: INT=9, rest 3\npaladin mins: CHA=17, WIS=13, STR=12, CON=9, rest 3\nranger mins: CON=14, WIS=14, STR=13, DEX=13, rest 3\nother classes mins: generally light floors\n\nIn other words: paladins and rangers have significantly higher rolls on average.\n\nSidenote: in 2e you actually rolled stats first, and only if you met the requirements could you become a Paladin / Ranger. It's an interesting choice. Would not call this fun.\n\nAnyway. Is it possible to incorporate these floors into our modelling?\nAbility Distributions\nIf floors are involved at earlier stages, we have to take a step back and look at the distributions that make up the sum. We can compute distributions for individual ability scores (even if floored) if we use the distribution for $P(x, 3, 6)$ from mathworld/Dice where s=6 and n=3 and censor it at a cutoff point similar to how we censor the total distribution.\nComputing the value without a floor follows the same setup as when we did 18 dice; use wolfram alpha and tabulate for $[3, \\ldots, 18]$:\n\n\nthen we truncate + scale this at the observed floor points 9, 12, 13, 14, and 17:\n\n\nTo avoid having to write out conditionals $P(X = x| X\\ge k)$ everywhere we will denote $X^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor}$ as one of these graphed multinomial distributions for the sum of 3d6 floored at $k$:\n$$X^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor} \\sim \\mathcal{M}^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor}(3d6)$$\nNote also that an unfloored ability score $X$ is equal to $X^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}$.\nWe can then compute precise conditional expectations by floor:\n\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}) = \\mathbb{E}(X) = 3\\sum_{k=1}^{6}\\frac{k}{6} = 3*3.5 = 10.5$\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor}) = 11.8125$\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor12\\rfloor}) = 13.5555$\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) = 14.2500$\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor}) = 15.0000$\n$\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}) = 17.2500$\n\nSimilarly, we can compute precise variances:\n\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}) = Var(X) = 3\\sum_{k=1}^6\\frac{(x_i - 3.5)^2}{6} = 3*2.92 = 8.75$\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor}) = 4.5773$\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor12\\rfloor}) = 2.2469$\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) = 1.6875$\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor}) = 1.2000$\n$Var(X^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}) = 0.1875$\n\nSum of Ability Distributions\nTo get a distribution for the total score, we need to create a sum distribution of the distributions for their six base stats at their given class floors.\nDefine $Z_{paladin}$, $Z_{ranger}$ and $Z_{fighter}$ as:\n$$Z_{paladin} = X_1^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor} + X_2^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor} + X_3^{\\lfloor12\\rfloor} + X_4^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor} + X_5^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_6^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}$$\n$$Z_{ranger} = X_1^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor} + X_2^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor} + X_3^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor} + X_4^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor} + X_5^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_6^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}$$\n$$Z_{fighter} = X_1^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor} + X_2^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_3^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_4^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_5^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor} + X_6^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor}$$\nfor floored 3d6 based random variables $X_i^{\\lfloor N \\rfloor}  \\sim \\mathcal{M}^{\\lfloor N \\rfloor}(3d6)$.\nUsing the computed expectations above to sum across the 6 main stats:\n\n$\\mathbb{E}(Fighter) = \\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor}) + 5\\mathbb{E}(X) = 64.31$\n$\\mathbb{E}(Ranger) = 2\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor}) + 2\\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) + 2\\mathbb{E}(X) = 79.5$\n$\\mathbb{E}(Paladin) = \\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}) + \\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) + \\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor12\\rfloor}) + \\mathbb{E}(X^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor})+ 2\\mathbb{E}(X) = 77.86$\n\nand similarly for variance:\n\n$Var(Fighter) = Var(X^{\\lfloor9\\rfloor}) + 5Var(X) \\thickapprox 6.95^2$\n$Var(Ranger) = 2Var(X^{\\lfloor14\\rfloor}) + 2Var(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) + 2Var(X) \\thickapprox 4.82^2$\n$Var(Paladin) = Var(X^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}) + Var(X^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}) + Var(X^{\\lfloor12\\rfloor}) + Var(X^{\\lfloor3\\rfloor})+ 2Var(X) \\thickapprox 5.12^2$\n\nnoting that variables are independent under the observed two stage censoring.\n\nWhy can we rely on two stage censoring and their independence? If any of these internal mechanisms used some kind of if condition or min function, it would be immediately obvious from the distribution. The paladin distribution of charisma is clearly a ~1/4 for an 18, and ~3/4 for a 17; it would have been much rarer to see an 18 otherwise.\n\nThus, the distributions of our classes are based on multinomal-based distributions with the following first moments:\n\n$Uncensored\\ Fighter \\sim \\mathcal{M}(\\mu = 64.31, \\sigma^2 = 6.95^2)$\n$Uncensored\\ Ranger \\sim \\mathcal{M}(\\mu = 79.5, \\sigma^2 = 4.82^2)$\n$Uncensored\\ Paladin \\sim \\mathcal{M}(\\mu = 77.86, \\sigma^2 = 5.12^2)$\n\nThis is nice as a quick overview of what's best in the higher ranges, but it's not very precise. Without the PMF for the sum of our ability scores, it's hard to give good values for what the truncated version will look like (we are censoring in two stages). In particular, these heavily floored random variables end up giving us quite asymmetrical distributions in the tails.\nClass Distributions\nThankfully, it is possible to inductively compute the pmf of $Z_{class}$ via convolution.\nSome internet digging notwithstanding; most answers found online for this required either mathematica functions (that we do not have here in our inlined source), or a slightly more laborious manual convolution. We will follow the inductive convolution approach which we can solve with recursion. Paladin case:\nLet $X_{12} = X_1^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor} + X_2^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}$. We can generate values for the pmf $p_{X_{12}}$ for $X_{12}$ via the pmfs $p_{X_i}$ for $X_1^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}$ and $X_2^{\\lfloor13\\rfloor}$ via the convolution formula:\n$$P(X_{12} = n) = \\ (p_{X_1} * p_{X_2})(n) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}P(X_1=m)P(X_2 = n-m)$$\nThis step is particularly easy for the paladin, because $X_1^{\\lfloor17\\rfloor}$ only takes two values (i.e. $m=17$ ahd $m=18$ are the only non-zero parts in the sum).\nThe rest is more laborious to do by hand, as the sums get increasingly large while we iterate towards $Z=P_{123456}$ by repeatedly applying convolution to the remaining $X_i$:\n$$P(X_{123} = n) = \\ (p_{X_{12}} * p_{X_3})(n) \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}P(X_{12}=m)P(X_3 = n-m)$$\n$$P(X_{1234} = n) = \\ (p_{X_{123}} * p_{X_4})(n) \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}P(X_{123}=m)P(X_4 = n-m)$$\n$$P(X_{12345} = n) = \\ (p_{X_{1234}} * p_{X_5})(n) \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}P(X_{1234}=m)P(X_5 = n-m)$$\n$$P(X_{123456} = n) = \\ (p_{X_{12345}} * p_{X_5})(n) \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}P(X_{12345}=m)P(X_6 = n-m)$$\nThe hard work is correctly matching indexes in our probability arrays that serve as our mass functions to the sum, and defaulting to zero when accessing out of bounds:\n\nUsing this, we can compute the PMF for $Z_{class} = X_{123456}$:\n$$P(Z_{class} = z) = \\ (((((p_{X_1} * p_{X_2}) * p_{X_3}) * p_{X_4}) * p_{X_5}) * p_{X_6}) (z)$$\nand we graph them for various classes:\n\n\n\nNotice the heavily tilted ranger/paladin distributions whose lean is distinctively more to the right.\n\nThe last thing that's left now is to rectify $Z_c$ at 75 to get our true, final distributions:\n\n\nThese match the sampled data almost perfectly as can be seen in more detailed comparisons in the appendix.\nAs can be seen; ranger is faster at getting high numbers, particularly in the 90 -&gt; 97 range, but if you want rolls &gt;= 100, paladin rolls the highest at the fastest rate.\nWe end with the expected time to roll above a certain threshold where we use the most efficient class based on the number:\n\n108 paladin rolls once in 100 billion ⇒ 210y\n107 paladin rolls once in 5 billion ⇒ 10y\n106 paladin rolls once in 600 million ⇒ 1y\n105 paladin rolls once in 100 million ⇒ 11w\n104 paladin rolls once in 19 million ⇒ 2w\n103 paladin rolls once in 5 million ⇒ 4d\n102 paladin rolls once in 1.4 million ⇒ 1d\n101 paladin rolls once in 400k ⇒ 7h\n100 paladin/ranger rolls once in 150k ⇒ 3h\n99 ranger rolls once in 57k ⇒ 1h\n98 ranger rolls once in 23k ⇒ 25m\n97 ranger rolls once in 10k ⇒ 11m\n96 ranger rolls once in 5k ⇒ 5m\n95 ranger rolls once in 2k ⇒ 2m\n\nHope you have enjoyed this random brain dump on probability.

This is a post for myself with various information as a conclusion to my recent fixation into designing an efficient and compact factorio megabase.\n\nPlan\nI keep coming back to this game about once a year. There is something very soothing about the type of play this game encourages. Playing factorio basically feels like being part of some parallel software project; there's builtin dashboards, circuit logic, sharable blueprints, benchmarks, optimizations, and all without the usual externalities of a large software org/project. And at this point for me, it's all about the optimization and theorycrafting.\nI set out with the following goal:\n\nproduce 2 full blue lanes of every science or 5400 SPM (Science Per Minute)\n\nCertain cheats were used to avoid the less challenging parts of the game:\n\nspawning ore / resources (to minimize ore replacement and transport work)\nspeeding up the game (to simulate idling / expansion and simplify moving around)\ndisabling pollution (as the biters were contained and later defeated anyway)\n\nthis lets us focus on the parts of the game that's more interesting to me; optimizing the factory without having to deal with stuff running out or setting up new chaotic trains all the time. It also enables us to optimize the medium sized factory pieces in complete isolation without suddenly being limited by ore or UPS (that's the equivalent part of managing a software project I am trying to avoid).\n\nCopy-pasting small cell bases is currently the leading way to get the most productive bases without choking the game (i.e. maintaining 60 UPS).\n\nWe set out to make each science build be entirely self-contained with just a single train station as an output, and we built upon an old starter base that had already achieved almost 200 mining productivity.\nSideprojects\nBut before we get into it, here are several other things we built along the way that (in true factorio style) did not in any way contribute to the main goal.\nWildlife Preserve\n..to justify all those military upgrades:\n\nwhich we eventually eradicated in a comically inelegant way:\n\n    \n\nFishing Outpost\nA sustainable ecosystem catching 600 fish over its lifetime on its own power/robo network. Built right above the launchers:\n\nWood Burner\nAn automated train service to get rid of all that wood:\n\n    \n\n(normally triggers automatically, but there were no wood in the requester chests).\nFactory Designs\nRails\nWhen starting out with production/purple science I originally had 16 full blue belts of rails that fed into the purple science factories. Now we make rails inline in a single factory that feeds 4 purple science assemblers:\n\nI've not seen anyone else do this, but it works pretty well. It sushies sticks around two columns, and does a bit of crate magic to fit 6 input inserters, 3 input lanes, and 4 output inserters inside a 12 beaconed bounding box, but it actually works in the end.\nGreen Circuit / Plastic Row\nOne of the more optimized factory pieces. A single lane that produces a mostly full, mixed plastic/green blue belt.\n\nIt requires very precise spawning of coal, iron, copper so that we can have 2 chemical plants for plastic, and 4 smelters of iron + copper for a single 12 beaconed green factory. Some of the time all the furnaces are running:\n\nThe green factory is what requires special attention here:\n\nOne green factory alone can actually ALMOST supply a half belt (22.4 out of 22.5) if you can fully beacon it. It's just that doing this is very difficult because it takes more than a full blue belt of copper cables that it is very hard to supply it while making room for all the the iron and the outputs. This is why there's a car in between the beacons that serves as a chest.\nA car can be picked up from and inserted to at very strange angles at more than one length so it's great for fitting irregular gaps that doesn't work with chests (or would require more inserters). The game doesn't want you to do this though. It cannot be copy-pasted so you have to plant it manually. Doshington showcases the pain this type of design leads to .\nYou actually have to remove one middle beacon when the inserters starts running to trick the inserters to lock onto the car before planting the beacon down again (otherwise they want to grab the speed modules).\nThe end result is that you can transfer 24 cables to the assembler through a one space gap on every swing cycle.\nRed Circuit Row\nContinuing onwards from the green / plastic row, is another inline copper smelter section that joins into a nearly full copper cable assembler, that sufficiently feeds 8 factories of red chips.\nThe red chips are also inserter clocked so they all swing together which looks very satisfying, but I don't think it actually helps with UPS.\n\nThis joins onto the green setup so we can end up with these huge stacks for large red factories like this one for RCUs:\n\nLow Density Row\nA full row of low density structures can consist of 10 fully beaconed factories supplied by two lanes of copper. It needs a lot of belts, and manual input setup, plus a bunch of inserters to load onto the belt and back in from the belt, so we searched for a more direct setup (without sacrificing too much at the number of machines).\nThe end setup has 20 smelters to 10 LDS assemblers, which is an extra 4 smelters than is needed, so we beacon them slightly less, but end up with 100% direct insertion on copper. The downside? Lots and lots of cars.\n\nThis 70/s LDS factory for space science consists of 14 rows of 10 cars each, which is definitely a hassle to setup and filter.\nIdeally the equally sized steel would be lined up to face LDS on the input side (like they are in yellow science below), because here we mix belts first then use splitters later just to avoid a 14 lane wide thing through the base.\nRegardless, it looks different to everything else and is kind of beautiful at night:\n\nEnjoying the efficiency of the ratios. All the smelters are running (94% avg utilization).\nLabs\n\nExtracted this more conventional lab design to test it out UPS Wars 6: Labs for this with this entry. Nothing remarkable, except perhaps for the long winding belts in different direction. It's slightly overscaled to ensure it will fully drain half belts.\nTrains\nAll of the science cities / space component cities unload onto one of two major unload depots.\nThe main depots have robo networks to distribute nuclear fuel from a single supply train and they only stop at the hub (which is enough).\nLab Depot\nLab depot looks like a close-up of a complicated circuit:\n\n\nVery happy with this unload station. We pull exactly 4 half-belts and that can be perfectly filled via two inserters (with an 8 size override) at the cost of less buffer chests (that we don't need those). No splitters anywhere!\nRocket Depot\nProbably not the most efficient train unloading, but gotta get 4 wagons of stuff into 6 launchers via 2 inserters per launcher so it's tricky.\n\n\nLot's of 2x3 splitters and an eventually emptying unloader with a priority line down to satellites... It's ultimately a little overscaled compared to the other sciences so a few seconds of semi-filled belts, while not particularly efficient, doesn't hurt production.\nNuclear Fuel\nA minimal fuel factory that supplies all trains (piggy-backing on any oil refinery because it uses basically nothing). It's almost never active because it only has destination stops available when the hubs have less than 200 items on the receiving chests (circuit network on the receiving side).\n\nScience Cities\nQuickly going through these with factorio calc links.\nRed\nMax beaconing reds would give an awkward ratio whereas doing pairs here gives us just enough with 12F each column.\nIt would be possible to do 11F we did some at higher beaconing though.\n\nGreen\nMax beaconed smelters and an ad-hoc &lt;4 half belt output of green circuits, and only max beaconing the last pack factory to fill the lane.\nAgain, max beaconing is just not enough with 12F per column pair, so doing pairs with one last max beaconed for 14Fx4. Zero splitters. More gear factories than necessary, but more direct insertion.\n\nboth red + green on the map:\n\nMilitary\nAnnoyingly large for something that's off most of the time. Lots of clocked smelters, and the actual main ingredient factories are tiny.. Did a cool inline wall thing for each row for the actual science pack, and a big grenade factory, but lots of room for improvement.\n\nOne fun thing here though; this factory shuts off its own power when the train station buffer chests is full and no trains are at the station (circuit network connected to the chests and the train station via a combinator). This saves on power, but not on UPS, sadly.\nChemical\nAll ore/oil/reds + inputs for reds on the left through the green car lane setup, and then on the right inline sulfur (turns out one chemical plant can supply 45/s chemical science). Uses basic oil here because it's not the most demanding, but other peoples' comments suggest it's probably a wash performance wise.\n\n\nProduction\n\na huge chunk of the factory is literally just dealing with steel for rails and furnaces:\n\nwhich is a slightly overscaled (as can be seen from the few inactive furnaces), but it's a bit unevenly drawn from atm.\n\nUtility\nSlightly overscaled (60F) and undersupplied (can supply 59F). 57F ended up in an awkward 3 column build that needed to be split a lot. Best to stick to 4 columns if you are going to load onto 4 wagons. Oil is split into two advanced oil parts; inner one for lube/sulfuric and the outer just for petroleum for LDS.\n\nSpace Science\nCan just be done with six rocket launchers running near constantly provided we have the ingredients.\nRCU\nSlightly overscaled because the speed module row looked awkward when optimal. Probably one of the most streamlined parts, but also most heavily abuses ore spawning (mixed lane inputs for both speed modules and blue processors).\nBlue build is from Stevetrov's cell base with a slight beaconing modification.\nTried tons of blue builds for this and they're either all massive (like this), or they need double the amount of inserters for slightly more production, or they are smaller, but need so many belt inputs of plates that it's super awkward to plot down and less efficient. Didn't benchmark this for UPS, just went with gut feel based on smelter uptime, inserter numbers and inserter activity.\n\nLDS\nSupplies both rockets and satellites.\n\nRF CF + RF2\nPartially from coal liquefaction just because i wanted to learn how to do it well. It's probably not the most optimal choice since it needs lots of mixed coal belts to get the coal in that deep (yes, yes).\nCF build is undersupplied with 12 refineries, but doing it that way allows us not to copy paste the advanced oil one another time.\nIt ends up being almost perfectly scaled for the rockets + satellites. Belts just start to fill before the next train arrives.\nAll the solid fuel factories piggy-back on the ore clock for less swings.\n\n\nPretty happy about the beaconing line-up with the refineries and chemical plants:\n\nSatellites\nThe final component. It's better to look at calculator links for Solar + Accumulators + Processors (the real output part of this chunk) because we leech LDS + RF from the trains.\n\nIt's a pretty ugly mess that was designed early, but it's clocked and beaconed everywhere. Oh, and there's only 5 inserters per sulfuric acid factory because cars.\n\nOptimization\nWe tried several major optimization strategies:\n\ninserter clocking on all ore smelters/batteries/red circuits/steel\nenabling large pages on linux\ninlining green chip production (i.e. less belts in favour of direct insertion)\nmax beaconing almost everywhere\nreducing robo networks to only the essentials\n\nand in general downscaling and optimizing flow:\n\nminimizing all builds (as close to zero inactive machines as possible)\nreducing number of active inserters, belts, hops per item\n\nBeyond the linked posts, the following technicalfactorio subreddit posts, and factorio benchmarks were also helpful:\n\nbot/belt advice\nsplitters + belt advice\ncars as chests benchmark\ninserter minimal train unloaders\nTrains waiting on TIME PASSED &amp;&amp; Full/Empty condition is more efficient than just Full/Empty\nMinimizing number of bots so their usage is close to 100% is the best\n\nWe did not go to the full-out direct insertion lengths that the most efficient bases go to where everything is inlined (because imo it ends up looking chaotic and huge, with lots of factories ending up idle a lot of the time), but it was truly fascinating to see the amount of rabbit holes you can go down here to optimize.\nFrom the limited amount of testing I personally did. These helped:\n\nsolid improvement by eliminating pollution (pre-measurements)\n~10% improvement by using large pages\n~10% improvement by clocking all smelters/batteries/solid fuel\n~10% improvement by using clocked direct insertion steel and killing robo networks\n~1% improvement by disabling the 300+ cars\n~0.5% improvement by removing the standalone fishing base\n~1% improvement by cutting 6x7x4 inserters at science unloading stations\n\nwhile these had no noticable improvements:\n\nrefactoring circuit clocks to run of the same central clock\neliminating biters (mine are generally passive except for artillery revenge attacks)\neliminating grass/trees/fish/cliffs\nreducing visual quality of the game\nprepending time passed conditions to trains\n\nInitial Measurements\nWhen doing this set of measurements the base looked like this:\n\nAfter all the optimizations above; we measured the following rough percentages of time of where the time was being spent in the game's update loop:\nSourcePercentms\nEntity update67%4.45ms\nElecric network13%0.85ms\nHeat manager9%0.62ms\nTransport lines8%0.57ms\nCircuit network2%0.18ms\nTrains1%0.06ms\n\nwhere the entities were broken down further using show-entity-time-usage:\nEntity ClassPercentms\nInserter46%1.80ms\nGenerator15%0.60ms\nBoiler11%0.44ms\nFurnace8%0.31ms\nAssembler7%0.29ms\nMiners5%0.19ms\nLabs1%0.04ms\n\nwhich illustrates why inserter-clocking can be so effective - as it's always such a big part of a factory - but it also highlights the next offender; nuclear.\n\nHeat manager (heat exchangers) uses 9% of the update time\nGenerator + Boiler uses 26% of entity time (0.67=17% of the update time)\n\nThis is actually a over a quarter of the time. Not what I had expected from a not-that-badly-designed nuclear setup (no steam storage, minimal exchanger network, optimal reactor efficiency bonuses). It's a lot more than people publically estimate, but to give them some credit, the percentage seen on my end would be amplified by already having optimized the hell out of all the inserters.\n\nWe ran the base on two big nuclear reactors sites producing 33GW in total.\n\n\nThis reactor block gave us ~60% of the power output with 120 of the 204 total reactors.\nOpening up the save in creative mode and ripping out nuclear in favour of an infinite energy interface bumped UPS from 150 to over 200.. how would that translate if we used nearly a million solar panels instead? how much space would that take? how much time would that take...\nSolar Project\nWell, I had already sunk this much time into it, so thought I'd spend a weekend on it. How fun could it be?\nWell, the answer is somewhat.. Provided you shut off the rest of the factory (so you can run 4-8x speed), and then run boost around with a bunch of rc'd spidertrons:\n\n    \n\nwith some strategic landfill factories taking advantage of huge mining prod:\n\nStill, definitely a repetivite background task (that took two days..)\n..but how did it measure up?\n\nOn gamespeed 5 we saw a near 40% improvement to UPS from 150 to 208.\n\nBreaking the new measurements (1, 2) down, we see:\nSourcePercentmsChange\nEntity update71%3.12ms-1.33ms\nTransport lines13%0.57ms0\nElecric network11%0.48ms-0.38ms\nCircuit network4%0.17ms0\nTrains1%0.06ms0\nHeat manager0%0.00ms-0.62ms\n\nand looking into the entities:\nEntity ClassPercentmsChange\nInserter72%2.29ms-0.49ms\nFurnace11%0.35ms~0\nAssembler9%0.29ms~0\nMiners6%0.19ms0\nLabs1%0.04ms0\nBoiler0%0.01ms-0.43ms\nGenerator0%0.00ms-0.60ms\n\n(There's likely only precision to one decimal place here as we saw saw 0.04ms changes in furnace and assemblers despite having no actual changes in game. The numbers do have some variance on their own in the big base and we are just operating on screenshots.)\nThe update loop itself saw a nearly equivalent improvement with 6.24ms to 4.53ms.\nEnd Performance\nThe UPS went from around 110 to 208 on average from redesigns, clocking and the mentioned tweaks, where a good chunk of this came from the base design itself. The most braindead change with the biggest improvement was switching to solar (with nearly 40% improvement at the time - your mileage will vary). The changes with the most performance gains by time investment was turning on large pages (5min job), and turning off + clearing pollution (1min job).\nIn the end, the island now looks like this:\n\ni.e. largely the same, but without nuclear, and solar everywhere.\nhow much solar? oh i'm sorry, that screenshot was cropped..\n\nyeah. that's a lot more than expected. When designing solar, ensure you overscale by 42% to cover the night.\nBlueprints\nExported these pieces:\n\nCommands\nExpand Commands\n\nOne time commands:\n\nremove pollution\nSet /c game.speed=5 to try to run as fast as possible\n\nSpawn resources:\n\nDelete resources (of any kind) in a 10x10 square around you:\n\nSpawn a 2x4 water pond below you:\n\nDisable cars (see the cars as chests benchmark):\n\nLarge pages\nInstall mimalloc and set start command on factorio via steam:\n\nSettings are documented via mi-alloc. Large pages makes the most difference, but huge pages also works well.\n\n\nResults\nIn the end, all the optimizations meant we could run the 5400 SPM base at 210 UPS on my machine (i.e. the game managed to run the game at 3.5x real speed on average). With 20% productivity modules in labs, and that game speed scale, we effectively research ~23k science per minute, or 1.4 million science per hour.\nIf you want to view it interactively or play it, you can download or view full base/save on factoriobox.\n","description":"Lessons from building a Factorio Megabase","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2022-10-31-factober/","title":"Factober 5400"},"https://clux.dev/post/2022-12-07-running-year/":{"body":"In an attempt to torture my chair shaped husk of a body, I somehow ran almost 2500km this year.

Just as one symptom disappeared another came in to replace it.\nWhile my stress graph on the worst day looked pretty benign (mostly medium stress), my partner's stress graph on Garmin was the worst I have ever seen (with &gt;10 hours of high stress in one day). Still, the fever was pretty bad for me, and am now getting light headed doing easy things 6 days on, so it's definitely not \"just a cold\".\nBMJ has a Graduated Return To Play Guidance Protocol and based on only having some \"below-the-neck\" systemic symptoms (fever), I am only planning on doing light jogging during the second half of December if/once 🤞 it's possible to:\n\ncomplete all activities of daily living without excessive fatigue and/or breathlessness and be able to walk on the flat without getting breathless\n\nSo, yeah. Use your masks while indoors people. Each time you get reinfected, the risks increase. Hopefully, I can find a way back.\nRandom Thoughts\nNext year\nProvided recovery allows; I hope to keep the volume. It is a bit much - and just doing a fraction of it will for sure be enough to just stay healthy - but I kind of want to see how far I can stretch it for a bit longer. It's also made me feel sharper.\nWant to train specifically for shorter distances like 1M / 3000 / 5k, even though beating PBs at this points does come with 8+ hours of mandatory training a week and injury risks so how much this is carried on next year is heavily conditional on nothing bad happening - a statement generally not served with good odds in the 2020s.\nNot planning on higher distance events like marathons just because of how detrimental it seems to be to your overall immune system and how much recovery you need. My current line of thinking is; why train for 4 months for an event that takes you out of the game for 2-4 weeks? Better find a smooth average that you can sustain.\n\nbrain: he says this while planning on beating PBs; requiring the opposite of smooth averages.\n\nAnyway, running has been a fun side-project that's not been software related. It's been interested reading about how professionals train, and seeing effects first hand.\nShoes\nThe silliest thing about this accessible sport though; is the amount of shoes you burn through. If you run 100k a week, and follow the 500-800k recommendation for max shoe mileage, you'll blast through 5-10 pairs of running shoes a year, costing you somewhere from £500-2000 per year for high end shoes. The £60 I paid to run in Royal Parks was actually worth it just for the 15% off coupon at a running shoe store.\nOn the plus side, this is temporary. Wish you all good health in 2023.\n","description":"a year of irl track any%","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2022-12-07-running-year/","title":"Running 2022"},"https://clux.dev/post/2023-10-01-drop-down-terminal/":{"body":"As a former Quake player, I have been a long-term user of guake for a quick access terminal on Linux.\nHowever, as guake is gnome specific, continued use became problematic once a mac got thrust upon me for work. So herein is a workaround for making your own drop-down terminal for Linux and Mac by utilizing alacritty + zellij.\n\nLooks\nBehold; a semi-transparent, tabbed terminal hovering above two browser windows (showing the editing process of this very post):\n\nThis is using a transparent theme in helix, with 80% opacity in alacritty, and disabled blur in hyprland to selectively see through below (like for say live updates to the markdown rendering). On mac, the setup and looks are very similar to this.\n\nFor times when transparency is too annoying you can bind a key to change the helix theme to something fully opaque (most themes are opaque). A quick F1 press ultimately slides the terminal away from view anyway.\n\nCore Concept\nThe idea is to have a persistent terminal that is hidden away in a \"special place\" and bind a key to toggle the visibility of this terminal. Then we rely on zellij to provide tabs.\n\nThe choice of terminal emulator and multiplexer is not super important. You could probably use kitty + tmux, or straight wezterm (which has tabs mgmt built-in) if you prefer, and achieve similar results.\n\nOn wayland that place is a special workspace, whereas on mac we use sticky windows.\nAlacritty Setup\nMy preferred setup is to always launch zellij at alacritty start by configuring the default shell in the alacritty.yml config:\n\nand, since this is a drop-down terminal we are selling, you probably also want transparency (because otherwise why do you need the window to go in front? just switch applications or workspaces):\n\non linux we can also make it as clean as possible and remove most window decorations:\n\nwhereas on mac a similar decoration setup is buttonless:\n\n(and you can also experiment with binding a key to ToggleSimpleFullscreen there).\nZellij Setup\nHonestly, this is pretty nice out of the box. Mostly styling is nice here to make it cleaner:\n\ngrab a theme.\n\nThe -l compact startup option set in the alacritty config assumes familiarity in zellij, you're likely to find it easier to onboard if you don't use compact mode until you are familiar.\n\nTab Names\nIf you don't want to faff around with naming every single zellij tab, you can also make zsh do it automatically for you using chpwd_functions using something like this in your .zshrc etc:\n\nThis is nice because it catches all sources of traversal, be it through cd or through jumpers like zoxide.\nDrop Down Variants\nThe most ergonomic one here is the hypland variant, but the mac setup is also decent.\nHyprland\nOn Linux with hyprland (my current wayland compositor), plugging this in is very easy to do because you have access to special workspaces, so the terminal is never technically hidden, it's just active in a different workspace.\n\nThis might not seem like a big deal, but if you've tried sharing a terminal that hides itself (such as guake's or through the mac solution below) on a screen sharing video call, you will find various failure modes (from app crashes to stream closes) if you hide the window you are sharing.\n\nIn your hyprland.conf, add:\n\nso it auto-starts in special, and you can toggle the workspace as you wish.\nGive it an animation so it pops in vertically, and avoid undercutting your opacity:\n\nAnd the final hyprland quirk; special workspaces have a window scaling factor (default 0.8) that controls how much large the window is allowed to be. If you are putting a terminal editor in there or something you probably want to max that out:\n\nThe end result is a terminal that pops in from the bottom in an inverted quake terminal feel - and honestly this makes more sense than top-to-bottom since you have to give some space to the (usually top) waybar.\nHammerspoon\nOn Mac, the easiest setup is using hammerspoon. Bind a toggle or start alacritty in your hammerspoon's init.lua:\n\nIt is a little flimsy on a multi-monitor setup, with sometimes having to manually move it across to a workspace on a different monitor on boot (window/workspace/monitor hierarchy seems less clean on mac in general), but it helps to not auto-start the app and let the bind start it on the monitor you  have your cursor by only pressing the bind there.\nThe alacritty opacity setting is respected out of the box.\nIf you are using it with yabai (for auto-tiling of windows, window moving shortcuts), then you also want to add a rule for yabai to mark it as sticky to avoid it getting bunched up as a normal window tile:\n\nBecause it is using sticky windows, screen sharing of this window will not be viable by itself (as the source disappears when it's hidden), so you'll have to share the entire workspace instead. This is usually not a big deal if you are already using workspaces.\nXorg\nAll setups I found for this were comically bad, but including one for completeness. Don't use this. Stay on guake if you are on X. The hack below majorly struggles with multi-monitor.\n\nAside: you should consider moving onto wayland if you haven't.\n\nYou need a script that auto-runs in your shell, and a runnable function:\n\nThis expects alacritty is on autorun and you can configure binds somewhere. I put an F2 bind in cinnamon (yeah, long time between changing WMs for me) to run this.\n\nAgain; I don't use this. I wrote it as a short stop-gap and I hated it.\n\nHaving to support Mac + X in my dotfiles became a perfect storm of frustration, and wouldn't you know it, wayland made everything better.\n..as with many things, the answer is to migrate away from X.\n","description":"Recreating guake on top of alacritty and zellij in wayland and macos","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2023-10-01-drop-down-terminal/","title":"Drop Down Terminal"},"https://clux.dev/post/2023-12-22-kubecon-chicago-log/":{"body":"As time goes by, I find myself increasingly disinterested in actually travelling out to a convention, when my preferred method of consuming conference talks is overwhelmingly VOD form with 2x/FF potential.\nThis is doubly so when the convention is increasingly corporate (like KubeCon), and the CNCF youtube channel is in general high quality.

Some frequented returns:\n\nyt/BobbyBroccoli :: for great long form science controvery deep dives\nyt/Tantacrul :: for a yearly hinge expose on music\nyt/hbomberguy :: for his yearly expose on who knows what\nyt/thejuicemedia :: for their snappy government parody ads\nyt/MonarchsFactory :: TTRPG concepts and mythology\nyt/mcolville :: TTRPG game mechanics and game design\nyt/chopininstitute :: classical piano recitals and the chopin competition (last winner)\nyt/HarstemCasts :: intelligent starcraft 2 casts from top level player when you need a break\nyt/ESLArchives :: SC2/Dota2 tournament vods from ESL\nyt/AfreecaTV :: more starcraft: GSL + ASL\nyt/DoshDoshington :: for well-narrated Factorio Mod runthroughs\nyt/KimuraTails :: insane Trackmania (united) TASes\nyt/cncf :: boring conference talks on cloud tech, but they allowed me to avoid some flying\nyt/HealthyGamerGG :: Dr K. with a pragmatic stoicism + meditation focused philosophy takes\n\n\nWould I still watch as much youtube if I couldn't 2X all speech and bypass ads? Probably not. Long form media is a lesser toll on my continually stretched focus though.\n\nAs for actual full-runtime content, most my streaming services were cancelled last year, and the only one left is crunchyroll, which i guess makes me a full time weeb now. I would fight that, but Love is War and Spy x Family were also the funniest shit I have seen this year.\nHardware\n2023 was an upgrade year, a first since 2017, so have once again delved into the increasingly confusing realm of hardware for my #linux desktop workstation. Wendell from Level1Tech + GamersNexus were the most helpful for guiding me in good linux-compatible setups. Ended up going full AMD to make my time with Wayland less painful, and with less funny flags.\nThe new rig is great. It has ~4x faster compile-iteration cycles, and it uses less power than my old one!\nGames\nOn the steam front, my timesinks were heavier games for a change. One even from this year:\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 obviously. I have spent days just theorycrafting its predecessors, and it's GOTY for a reason. Great storytelling, lots of great game mechanic ideas for making 5e better. RIP September.\nBorderlands 3. BL2 still holds a special place in my heart for its chill coop, item hunting / diablo vibes, so this year, when r/bl3 started being positive again - after years of annoying users by breaking the game, nerfing builds, changing the endgame - and my PC got upgraded, it was time. The weapon farming system is fun, the builds are cool, and the Cthulhu themed expansion really stands out as exceptionally beautiful. RIP July.\nManifold Garden was the surprise hit. Its infinitely repeating take on first-person puzzle solving, ventures into a deeply psychadelic fractal space, and one that is captivatingly beautiful.\n\nThe amount of theorycrafting videos consumed during the RPG periods also shows that the desire to min-max is still very much alive.\nCoffee\nTo stay woke, I rabbit-holed into home-espresso making (like many of my tech friends), and as a result, I can now make a great cup with pretty cheap components (basic delonghi dedica + non-pressurized portafilter + a good hand-grinder), given good beans. While the famous hoffmann was helpful for his insights into coffee science, nowadays the routine has kicked in, and the joffman parody channel is more amusing.\nWhile it is fun to try to replicate the perfect asian dirty coffee, or a thai style es-yen, most of the time I just pull a shot, ice it, and pour over some oatly for a great lazy iced latte.\nOpen Source\nThe kube-rs ecosystem continues with 13 new kube releases this year. Lots of features landed; socks5 proxying, rustls default, new configs for watcher + Controller, streaming lists, controller streams interface, oidc refresh, metadata api + metadata_watcher, store readiness.\nThankfully, I can largely PM the ship, and leave most larger features to others. Stream sharing is close, k8s-pb integration can be started, client-v2 is restarted, and am enjoying expanding docs on kube.rs (particularly the controller guide) to simplify Q/A in the future.\nStepping outside kube, python-yq has been rewritten in rust. This is both a fun and necessary project for me (not solved by the go rewrite). This is a small project, because we are just deferring to jq, but it is very satisfying how simple things can be when you are not trying to re-invent the wheels.\nHelix\nThe helix editor (replacing VS Code) is the first modal editor I've managed to stick to, and a big reason for this is how compassionate the UX is; menus give me the key-shortcuts I have forgotten, I can search for commands, and the speculative LSP integrations are amazing.\nAm actually using helix as my new #pkm rather than foam because the markman lsp actually lets me do most of what I expect from a second-brain anyway! Symbol search for H1s or H2s, and Goto definition for wikilinks are both unexpected LSP features.\nPositivity\nIn a world full of systemic problems, mute + block has never felt more valuable. I have aggressively hit Dont recommend channel on captive news channels, and Indefinite mute on excessively drama-peddling / self-rightous profiles mastodon even when I largely agree with their general points.\nWith global problems that you often have very little influence over, what you risk (beyong the negative energy zapping) is the constant exposure to virtue signalling / schadenfreude, and increasingly polarised and dichotomous thinking, E.g. climate change discourse, frequently followed by either:\n\ndismissal due to existence of unrealistic and equally problematic solutions\nfutility focused activists that advocate for engaging in large scale industrial sabotage\n\n\nyes, i believe we are pretty fucked, but the fucking will continue whether i worry about it or not.\n\nTwitter was terrible in always exposing you to the angriest threads about this. Thankfully, in its demise, Mastodon is an improvement for what I was using twitter for; cross-link to/from blog-posts, follow posts from experts, and moderately engage while bored on a train. The Mute option actually works, and the defederation of negative echo chambers makes it feel more nstable (you are not in the hands of one indebted company).\nYou could make several good arguments for leaving twitter, but that's not the job of this post. I have found a new place, and it's a happier one.\n\nIf you want more positivity, you must opt-out of some negativity. Pick your battles.\n\nMountains\nThis year changed my approach to exercise, changing my goals from setting PBs in running events like 2022, to focus on fun, and exploring nearby mountains when they are available.\nThe biggest treks were the 5h trail runs up Doi Pui + Croix du Nivolet, and the 3d long Kumano Kodo pilgrimage trail with my partner. I also found incredible beauty and focus on hills requiring much less effort such as Doi Suthep, Fløya, &amp; Tindstinden.\nThere is a concrete beauty to trail running and hiking that I did not get while optimizing for performance. You are always present in the mountains. No podcasts, no \"get-it-done\" mentality; the journey is its own reward. The experience lasts, unlike a VO2max bump.\nBigger hikes are less realistic outside of travel for me, so it's still mostly flats. Air-travel is becoming a harder-to-defend and fleeting privilege, but I have to recognise that it's not really fair for a society to offload climate guilt on consumers despite a complete lack of systemic regulation.\n\nLike, I am car free and child free, but it's fucked that I feel the need to use that as an excuse.\n\nRoutine\nBeyond the above, my life is still largely routine:\n\nWalk to the park. Grind the coffee beans. Blitz some fruit. Triage issues. Play music. Appreciate beauty. Try to embrace being content, and try to be compassionate. Enjoy time with my partner.\n\nIf I get another full year, that is what I want to continue.\nSo here's to another year.\n","description":"journal of good things to be thankful for","id":"https://clux.dev/post/2023-12-31-annual-gratitude/","title":"Gratitude for 2023"},"https://clux.dev/post/shipcat-retrospective/":{"body":"The now defunct unicorn startup babylon health needed to micrate about 50 microservices to Kubernetes in early 2018. At Kubernetes 1.8, supporting tooling was weak, but the company pace was fast.\nThis is an historically updated post about shipcat, a standardisation tool written to control the declarative format and lifecycle of every microservice, and get safety quickly.\n\n\nThis article was updated after babylon's demise in 2023. It now serves as a mini-retrospective instead of the mostly broken announcement (with the original repo being down). We add some better showcases and examples, and historical context, that together should help avoid some common misconceptions about why this weird tool was written.\n\nFirst, a bit about the problem:\nKubernetes API\nMigrating to Kubernetes was a non-trivial task for a DevOps team, when the requirements where basically that we would do it for the engineers. We had to standardise, and we had to decide on what a microservice ought to look like based on what was already there.\nWe didn't want engineers to all have to learn everything about the following objects at once:\n\nConfigMap\nSecrets\nDeployment / ReplicaSet / Pod\nService\nHorizontalPodAutoscaler\nServiceAccount\nRole\nRoleBinding\nIngress\n\nWe needed validation. Admission control was new, didn't work well with gitops for fast client-side validation, and we just needed ci checks to prevent master from being broken.\nHelm\nThe most successful abstraction attempt Kubernetes had seen in this space; helm. A client side templating system (ignoring the bad server side part) that lets you abstract away much of the above into charts (a collection of yaml go templates) ready to be filled in with helm values; the more concise yaml that developers write directly.\nSimplistic usage of helm would involve having a charts folder:\n\nand calling it with your substitute myvalues.yaml:\n\nwhich will garbage collect older kube resources with the myapp label, and start any necessary rolling upgrades in kubernetes.\nDrawbacks\nEven though you can avoid a lot of the common errors by re-using charts across apps, there were still very little sanity on what helm values could contain. Here are some values you could pass through a helm chart to kubernetes and still be accepted:\n\nmisspelled optional values (silently ignored)\nresource requests exceeding largest node (cannot schedule nor vertically auto scale)\nresource requests &gt; resource limits (illogical)\nout of date secrets (generally causing crashes)\nmissing health checks / readinessProbe (broken services can rollout)\nimages and versions that does not exist (fails to install/upgrade)\n\nAnd that's once you've gotten over how frurstrating it can be to write helm templates in the first place.\nLimitations\nWhile validation is a fixable annoyance, a bigger observation is that these helm values files become a really interesting, but entirely accidental abstraction. These files become the canonical representation of your services, but you have no useful logic around it. You have very little validation, almost no definition of what's allowed in there (helm lint is lackluster), you have no process of standardisation, it's hard to test sprawling automation scripts around the values files, and you do not have any sane way of evolving these charts.\nEnter shipcat\n\nWhat if if we could take the general idea that developers just write simplified yaml manifests for their app, but we actually define that API instead? By actually defining the structs we can provide a bunch of security checking and validation on top of it, and we will have a well-defined boundary for automation / ci / dev tools.\nBy defining all our syntax in a library we can have cli tools for automation, and executables running as kubernetes operators using the same definitions. It effectively provides a way to versioning the platform.\nThis also allowed us to solve a secrets problem. We extended the manifests with syntax that allows synchronsing secrets from Vault at both deploy and validation time. There are better solutions for this now, but we needed something quickly.\nDisclaimer\nThis style of tool was not a revolutionary (nor clean) idea. At KubeCon Eu 2018 pretty much everyone had their own wrappers around yaml to help with these problems. For instance, kubecfg, ksonnet, flux, helmfile, all try to help out in this space, but they were all missing most of the sanity we required when we started experimenting.\n\nso, how to homebrew Kubernetes validation in an early stage gitops world\n\nThe result, perhaps unsurprisingly, was babylon dependent, fast moving, and not fit for general purpose. But it was still very helpful for the company.\nManifests\nThe user interaface we settled on were service-level manifests:\n\nThis encapsulated the usual kubernetes apis that developers needed to configure themselves, who's responsible for it, what regions it's deployed in, what secrets are needed (notice the IN_VAULT marker), and how resource intensive it is.\nIt's obviously quite limiting in terms of what you actually can do on Kubernetes, but this simple \"one deployment per microservice\" with some optional extras was generally sufficient for years.\nStrict Syntax\nBecause these manifests were going to be the entry point for CI pipelines and handle platform specific validation (for medical software), we wanted maximum strictness everywhere and that includes the ability to catch errors before manifests are committed to master.\nWe leant heavily on serde's customisable codegeneration to encapsulate awkward k8s apis, and to auto-generate the boilerplate validation around types and spelling errors.\nThe Kubernetes structs were handrolled for the most part, but later incorporated parts of k8s-openapi structs - however these were too Option-heavy to catch most missed-out fields on their own.\nHere are some structs we used to ensure resources and limits had the right format:\n\nHere, serde enforces the \"schema\" validation. It catches spelling-errors as extraneous types/keys due to the #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] instruction, and it enforces the correct types. But on the flip side, having this in code also required us updating the spec (to say, support ephemeral storage requirements).\nStill, this provided cheap schema validation (before helm got it) and there was also a verify method that every struct could implement. This genenrally encapsulated common mistakes that were clearly errors and should be caught before they are sent out to the clusters:\n\nUltimately, the Resources struct above was attached straight onto to the core Manifest struct (representing the microservice defn above). Devs would write standard resources and be generally unaware of the constraints until they were violated:\n\nIn this case, the syntax matches the Kubernetes API directly - and this was preferred - but had extra validation.\nWe did plan on moving validation to a more declarative format (like OPAs) down the line, but there was no rush; this worked.\nAll of the syntax ended up in shipcat/structs - and required developer code-review to modify since it could affect the whole platform.\nOnce a new version of shipcat was released, we bumped a pin for it in a configuration management monorepo with all the manifests, and the new syntax + feature become available for the whole company.\nCLI Usage\nDevelopers could check that their manifests pass validation rules locally, or wait for pre-merge validation on CI:\n\nthe last being roughly equivalent to:\n\nWe did always lean on helm charts for templating yaml, but this was always an implementation detail that only a handful of engineers needed to touch as we followed the one chart to rule them all approach. Templates were also linted heavily with kubeval against all services in all regions during chart upgrades.\nKubernetes Usage\nWe had wrappers around the normal shipcat template myapp | kubectl X pipeline:\n\nWe didn't really apply locally except when doing local testing, but we could. There was a glorified kubernetes context switcher that ensured we were pointing to the correct vault for the cluster, so it was pretty easy to test on and get accurate diffs.\nThe upgrade was much nicer than any other CLI that existed at the time, it tracked upgrades with deployment-replica progress bars, bubbled up errors, captured error logs from crashing pods, provided inline diffs pre-upgrade, gated on validation, sent successful rollout notifications to maintainers on slack.\nCI actually used this apply setup and reconciled the whole cluster in parallel using async rust with StreamExt::buffer_unordered:\n\nthis help avoid the numerous tiller bugs and actually let us define a sensible amount of time to wait for a deployment to complete (there's an algorithm in there for it).\nIn the end, we almost turned it into a CD controller, but in an awkward clash of new and old tech, we just ran the above reconcile command on jenkins every 5m lol.\n\nat the time helm 3 was planning to architect away tiller entirely.\n\nThe dev ergonomics was one of its biggest selling points (and possibly prevented a revolt against a ops-led + mandated tool). In my later jobs, achieving a similar level of dev ergonomics would take multiple microservices talking to flux.\nPerhaps all this does not seem that impressive now, but it helps if you have visited that precise layer of hell that helm 2 dominated. It had such a painful and broken CD flow.\nConclusion\nLooking back at this, it's a kind of wild everything-CLI. It accomplished the goal though. It moved fast, but did so safely. It was not universally well-received, but most of the people who complained about it early on later came to me later to say \"i don't know how else we could have done this\".\nIt also let us build a quick and simple service-registry on top of the service spec (there's a controller called raftcat that cross-linked to all the tools we used for each service).\nUltimately, it's not a tool most people know about, or at the very least not very well understood, and this makes sense. It was ultimately tied to babylon's platform. Why would you tell people about this, if not except out of interest? The more surprising nail in that coffin was in late 2022, when it was made private from its repo without much ceremony. Now only my safety fork remains.
