Hello. My name is `Eirik` and this site is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and to provide the occasional guide to software.

<small>Posts herein are my own opinions. Words like **we** or **us** is often used in the <abbr title="pluralis modestiae">mathematical sense</abbr> in posts, and does not imply consensus.</small>

### Software

For a living, I help automate software operations of modern businesses. Generally, this means integrating existing cloud technologies on Kubernetetes, but occasionally some new tool gets written. Language-wise, the last [six](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager/commit/5247fb2755cf936a81ed9e82ff6b7bbc0af8a03a) years have featured a lot of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to its safety guarantees and great ecosystem, but also like to [dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

My [github](https://github.com/clux) and [sponsors dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/clux) has a bigger overview, but some of my longer-term projects:

- 2018 [kube](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube) :: a kubernetes client and controller runtime for rust (donated to CNCF)
- 2016 [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) :: a [musl](https://musl.libc.org/) based build image for the cloud
- 2012 [tournament](https://github.com/tournament-js) :: a tournament state system for arbitrary competition formats

These days, **[kube](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube)** takes the biggest portion of my open source time, as it has grown from a personal yak to a quite popular part of the rust ecosystem. I used to [blog about kube](/tags/kubernetes), but now I slowly write [guides](https://github.com/kube-rs/website/issues/5) at [kube.rs](https://kube.rs) and mostly do issue management and release automation for these repos instead.

Past colleagues might remember me from these semi-open work projects:

- 2018 [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/clux/shipcat) :: babylon's helmfile like microservice system ([safety fork](https://github.com/clux/shipcat) - [was needed lol](/post/shipcat-retrospective/))
- 2016 [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) :: a language agnostic docker based build system ([safety fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal) by the [old build team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people))

At any rate, [software posts](/categories/software) here are all over the place. My setup is documented in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/clux/dotfiles) and [provisioning](https://github.com/clux/provision).

### Roleplaying

In less busy times, I spent years of my life DMing D&D campaigns. The longest one [concluded](/post/2021-12-05-campaign-concluded/) in pandemic times, and was a large part of my sanity in that period. Am currently absolved from further dubious plot juggling and a campaign related [todos](https://github.com/clux/facemaulers/search?q=TODO), but probably will resuming [roleplaying](/categories/roleplaying/) shenanigans at some point

### Education
There exists a dusty, but laminated piece of paper with `Master of Mathematics` on it. While no one has ever asked to look at it, it keeps being featured on my [resume](http://clux.github.io/vitae/).

This esoteric + deteriorating knowledge is mostly used to over-excitedly tell people about group theory, and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all; a solid use of `4` years.

### Music

As a kid, I played violin for a decade. Have got a couple of things to show for this; near perfect recollection of the solo-violinists repertoire, a weird desire to follow violin competitions, and a history of being a good target for bullying.

Nowadays, my [2017 p-series](https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/index.html) is my weapon of choice, and is helping me recover from violin trauma. It also continues my habit of committing useless chunks of finger movement to muscle memory, but comes with the side-effect of making me watch piano competitions.

<small>If you are considering buying a violin for yourself/someone. Buy an `otamatone` first to see if you think you can [handle](https://www.stoppingpoints.com/devils-dictionary/fiddle.html) listening to someone wrangling with a fretless, non-linear interface for years. The instrument UX is terrible. You deserve better.</small>

### Gaming
I _prefer_ to join **cooperative** multiplayer [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sszynrae) games whenever the stars align timing-wise.

However, in times of procrastination (as is more usually the case), well-designed game mechanics that require some type of dexterity based mastery, or hit a very specific nerd-sniping target, have frequently drawn me in. Here are some time sinks from the ages:
